AB  - BACKGROUND: The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic offers the opportunity to assess how hospitals manage the care of hospitalized patients with varying demographics and clinical presentations. The goal of this study was to demonstrate the impact of densely populated residential areas on hospitalization and to identify predictors of length of stay and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in one of the hardest hit counties internationally. METHODS: This was a single-center cohort study of 1325 sequentially hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in New York between March 2, 2020, to May 11, 2020. Geospatial distribution of study patients' residences relative to population density in the region were mapped, and data analysis included hospital length of stay, need and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. Logistic regression models were constructed to predict discharge dispositions in the remaining active study patients. RESULTS: The median age of the study cohort (interquartile range [IQR]) was 62 (49-75) years, and more than half were male (57%) with history of hypertension (60%), obesity (41%), and diabetes (42%). Geographic residence of the study patients was disproportionately associated with areas of higher population density (r (s) = 0.235; P = .004), with noted "hot spots" in the region. Study patients were predominantly hypertensive (MAP > 90 mmHg; 670, 51%) on presentation with lymphopenia (590, 55%), hyponatremia (411, 31%), and kidney dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2); 381, 29%). Of the patients with a disposition (1188/1325), 15% (182/1188) required IMV and 21% (250/1188) developed acute kidney injury. In patients on IMV, the median (IQR) hospital length of stay in survivors (22 [16.5-29.5] days) was significantly longer than that of nonsurvivors (15 [10-23.75] days), but this was not due to prolonged time on the ventilator. The overall mortality in all hospitalized patients was 15%, and in patients receiving IMV it was 48%, which is predicted to minimally rise from 48% to 49% based on logistic regression models constructed to project disposition in the remaining patients on ventilators. Acute kidney injury during hospitalization (odds ratio(E), 3.23) was the strongest predictor of mortality in patients requiring IMV. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to collectively utilize the demographics, clinical characteristics, and hospital course of COVID-19 patients to identify predictors of poor outcomes that can be used for resource allocation in future waves of the pandemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is little known about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (iRMD). We examined epidemiological characteristics associated with severe disease, then with death. We also compared mortality between patients hospitalised for COVID-19 with and without iRMD. METHODS: Individuals with suspected iRMD-COVID-19 were included in this French cohort. Logistic regression models adjusted for age and sex were used to estimate adjusted ORs and 95% CIs of severe COVID-19. The most significant clinically relevant factors were analysed by multivariable penalised logistic regression models, using a forward selection method. The death rate of hospitalised patients with iRMD-COVID-19 (moderate-severe) was compared with a subset of patients with non-iRMD-COVID-19 from a French hospital matched for age, sex, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Of 694 adults, 438 (63%) developed mild (not hospitalised), 169 (24%) moderate (hospitalised out of the intensive care unit (ICU) and 87 (13%) severe (patients in ICU/deceased) disease. In multivariable imputed analyses, the variables associated with severe infection were age (OR=1.08, 95%‚ÄâCI: 1.05-1.10), female gender (OR=0.45, 95%‚ÄâCI: 0.25-0.80), body mass index (OR=1.07, 95%‚ÄâCI: 1.02-1.12), hypertension (OR=1.86, 95%‚ÄâCI: 1.01-3.42), and use of corticosteroids (OR=1.97, 95%‚ÄâCI: 1.09-3.54), mycophenolate mofetil (OR=6.6, 95%‚ÄâCI: 1.47-29.62) and rituximab (OR=4.21, 95%‚ÄâCI: 1.61-10.98). Fifty-eight patients died (8% (total) and 23% (hospitalised)). Compared with 175 matched hospitalised patients with non-iRMD-COVID-19, the OR of mortality associated with hospitalised patients with iRMD-COVID-19 was 1.45 (95% CI: 0.87-2.42) (n=175‚Äâeach group). CONCLUSIONS: In the French RMD COVID-19 cohort, as already identified in the general population, older age, male gender, obesity, and hypertension were found to be associated with severe COVID-19. Patients with iRMD on corticosteroids, but not methotrexate, or tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 inhibitors, should be considered as more likely to develop severe COVID-19. Unlike common comorbidities such as obesity, and cardiovascular or lung diseases, the risk of death is not significantly increased in patients with iRMD.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) severity, ventilation management, and the outcomes of ICU patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and to determine risk factors of 90-day mortality post-ICU admission. METHODS: COVID-ICU is a multi-center, prospective cohort study conducted in 138 hospitals in France, Belgium, and Switzerland. Demographic, clinical, respiratory support, adjunctive interventions, ICU length-of-stay, and survival data were collected. RESULTS: From February 25 to May 4, 2020, 4643 patients (median [IQR] age 63 [54-71] years and SAPS II 37 [28-50]) were admitted in ICU, with day-90 post-ICU admission status available for 4244. On ICU admission, standard oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, and non-invasive ventilation were applied to 29%, 19%, and 6% patients, respectively. 2635 (63%) patients were intubated during the first 24¬†h whereas overall 3376 (80%) received invasive mechanical ventilation¬†(MV) at one point during their ICU stay. Median (IQR) positive end-expiratory and plateau pressures were 12 (10-14) cmH(2)O, and 24 (21-27) cmH(2)O, respectively. The mechanical power transmitted by the MV to the lung was 26.5 (18.6-34.9) J/min. Paralyzing agents and prone position were applied to 88% and 70% of patients intubated at Day-1, respectively. Pulmonary embolism and ventilator-associated pneumonia were diagnosed in 207 (9%) and 1209 (58%) of these patients. On day 90, 1298/4244 (31%) patients had died. Among patients who received invasive or non-invasive ventilation on the day of ICU admission, day-90 mortality increased with the severity of ARDS at ICU admission (30%, 34%, and 50% for mild, moderate, and severe ARDS, respectively) and decreased from 42 to 25% over the study period. Early independent predictors of 90-day mortality were older age, immunosuppression, severe obesity, diabetes, higher renal and cardiovascular SOFA score components, lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio and a shorter time between first symptoms and ICU admission. CONCLUSION: Among more than 4000 critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to our ICUs, 90-day mortality was 31% and decreased from 42 to 25% over the study period. Mortality was higher in older, diabetic, obese and severe ARDS patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Personal protective equipment (PPE) use is frequently construed as inconvenient and disturbing by health care professionals (HCPs). We hypothesized that new-onset symptoms among HCPs may be associated with extended use of PPE and aimed to investigate risk factors related with new-onset symptoms. In addition, the effects of new-onset symptoms on working performance were evaluated. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 315 participants filled out a questionnaire that contains 4 main parts: (1) demographics, (2) new-onset symptoms with PPE use, (3) PPE usage hours, and (4) personal opinion about the effect of sensed symptoms on working performance. RESULTS: The mean age was 31.58 ¬± 4.6 years, and 50.5% (n = 159) were female. New-onset symptom rate was 66% (n = 208). The most common new-onset symptom was headache (n = 115, 36.5%) followed by breathing difficulty-palpitation (n = 79, 25.1%), and dermatitis (n = 64, 20.3%). Extended use of PPE, smoking, and overweight were independently associated with developing new-onset symptoms. A clear majority of symptomatic participants pointed out the impact on working performance (193/208, 92.7%). CONCLUSION: Hospitals should take the necessary precautions (eg, shorter shifts and more frequent breaks) to prevent symptoms associated with PPE and ensure that HCPs comply with these precautions.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a significant challenge to public health systems worldwide. Obesity and malnutrition, two silent pandemics that were present before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, condition risk of the disease worsening in infected patients. Patients with this illness present with a high risk of disease-related malnutrition (DRM) and sarcopenia due to symptoms arising from the infection itself, acute inflammation, prolonged bed rest, and the supportive therapies used. Nowadays, along with respiratory support, nutritional support is essential to healthcare for patients with coronavirus infection throughout their progress. The nutritional approach is a dynamic process that includes strengthening the normal diet and specialized nutritional treatment (SNT) with the use of oral supplements, enteral nutrition, or parenteral nutrition according to each patient's requirements and needs. In this update, we review aspects regarding the close relationship between diet, nutrition, and immunity; their impact on the progress of SARS-CoV-2 infection; and the therapeutic strategies proposed by the consensus of experts of scientific societies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several descriptive cohort studies of patients affected by COVID-19 have been published. OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to Hospital Universitario la Plana, Castell√≥n, Spain. METHODS: Retrospective, observational cohort study that included 18-year-old or older patients who were consecutively admitted with SARS-CoV2 confirmed infection. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, laboratory results and radiological tests are described. RESULTS: The study included 255 patients with a mean age of 70 years; 54.9 % were males. Most common comorbidities were high blood pressure (58 %), dyslipidemia (42.4 %), diabetes (25.5 %) and obesity (24.3 %). Median number of days from the onset of clinical symptoms prior to hospital admission was seven. Most common manifestations prior to admission were fever (74.5 %), dry cough (61.2 %), malaise (51.8 %) and dyspnea (51.0 %); 19 patients (7.4 %) were admitted to the intensive care unit, where mortality was 50 %; overall mortality was 16.9 %. CONCLUSIONS: Our cohort reflects similar characteristics to those of other European series. Mortality was lower than that in similar studies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19-associated mortality in patients who require mechanical ventilation is unknown in the Mexican population. OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of Mexican patients with COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Observational cohort study carried out in an intensive care unit from March 25 to July 17, 2020. Data were obtained from a prospective database and electronic medical records, and were analyzed with the chi-square test, Fisher's exact test or Mann-Whitney's U-test. RESULTS: One hundred patients required mechanical ventilation; median age was 56 years, 31 % were females and 97 % were Latin American. Most common comorbidities were obesity (36 %), diabetes (26 %), hypertension (20 %), and chronic or end-stage kidney disease (10 %). At the end of the analysis, 11 patients remained in the ICU, 31 had been discharged alive and 58 (65.2 %) died; survivors were younger, had lower scores on severity and organ dysfunction scales, lower levels of C-reactive protein at ICU admission, were less likely to receive hemodialysis and vasopressors, and had longer hospital and ICU stays. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds information on the presentation and results of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients who require mechanical ventilation.

AB  - Limited data exists to date on the predictors for the development of pneumonia in patients with mild and moderate coronavirus (COVID-19). In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the demographic characteristics and clinical findings of mild and moderate COVID-19 and to determine the risk factors for the development of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients admitted to the pandemic outpatient clinic of a university hospital. A total of 414 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were included. Of these, 220 (53.1%) were male, the mean age was 38.3 ¬± 12.7. Median duration of hospital admission from the onset of symptoms was three days (0-11). Of the confirmed COVID-19 cases, 154 (37.2%) had a history of family contact and the most common symptoms were weakness (68.4%), myalgia (61.8%), headache (56.5%), loss of smell (45.2%), loss of taste (43.2%) and anorexia (42.8%). Among females, weakness (p= 0.016), headache (p= 0.008), sore throat (p= 0.032), nausea (p= 0.003), anorexia (p= 0.045), loss of taste (p= 0.005) and loss of smell (p<0.001) were more common. Loss of taste (47.6% vs. 25%, p<0.001) and loss of smell (50% vs. 26.3%, p<0.001) were more common in patients with under the age of 50 and cough (43.4% vs. 29.3%, p= 0.003) was more common in patients with above the age of 40. Among 46 (11.1%) patients with asymptomatic COVID-19, there was no significant difference (p= 0.500) between the genders. Pneumonia was detected in 150 (43.8%) of 339 patients who underwent thorax computed tomography. In the univariate analysis; advanced age (p<0.001, odds ratio (OR)= 1.44), obesity (p<0.001 OR= 2.5), not being actively smoking (p<0.001, OR= 6.19), fever at first admission (p= 0.002, OR= 2.02), cough (p<0.001, OR= 3.26), shortness of breath (p<0.001, OR= 23.37), weakness (p= 0.042, OR= 1.63), anorexia (p= 0.009, OR= 1.79) and elevation of D-dimer (p= 0.014, OR= 1.92) were associated with the development of pneumonia. In multivariate analysis, obesity (p= 0.005, OR= 2.69), not being actively smoking (p<0.001, OR= 5.43), cough at first admission p= 0.017, OR= 2.16) and shortness of breath (p= 0.008, OR= 16.22) was determined as an independent risk factor for the development of pneumonia. CRP (p<0.001), D-dimer (p<0.001), ferritin (p<0.001) values among 108 (26.1%) patients with a body-mass index(BMI) >30 were high, and 60.9% of the patients had pneumonia (p<0.001) . CRP (p<0.001), D-dimer (p= 0.010) values were low, lymphocyte count (p= 0.001) was high among 106 (25.6%) active smokers, and 15.6% of the patients had pneumonia (p<0.001). Of the patients reported with persistent symptoms, 25.9% had loss of smell, 25% had weakness, and 23.1% had loss of taste on the seventh day; 21.1% had loss of smell, 21.1% had myalgia, and 19.7% had loss of taste on the 14th day. During their follow-up, the COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was studied in 286 patients for control purposes. The median time of being negative for COVID-19 PCR test was eight days (3-56). In conclusion, symptoms may last longer than 14 days in 20- 30% of patients presenting with mild-moderate clinical findings. In addition, obesity should be considered as an important risk factor for COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a need for further data on the COVID-19 situation in Norway. Our aim was to describe the patients admitted to our local hospital with COVID-19 in the spring of 2020. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data were retrieved retrospectively from our local quality register for COVID-19 and include all patients admitted to √òstfold Hospital in the period 10 March 2020-31 May 2020. RESULTS: A total of 70¬†patients were admitted, of whom 47 (67¬†%) were men. The mean age was 59 years (range 18-95). The most common comorbid conditions were obesity (n = 22, 31¬†%), chronic coronary artery disease (n = 21, 30¬†%) and diabetes (n = 17, 24¬†%). Thirteen patients (19¬†%) had no comorbidities. The most common symptoms were cough (n = 56, 80¬†%), dyspnoea (n = 51, 73¬†%) and fever (n = 48, 69¬†%). The most frequent complications were cardiac manifestations (n = 18, 26¬†%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 14, 20¬†%) and acute kidney injury (n = 9, 13¬†%). Four (6¬†%) patients developed venous thromboembolism. Twenty patients (29¬†%) became critically ill. Thirteen (19¬†%) received treatment in the intensive care unit, and seven (10¬†%) died while in hospital. INTERPRETATION: Most of those admitted were middle-aged men. Many had no comorbidities. The most frequent non-respiratory complications were cardiac manifestations and kidney injury. A large proportion of patients became critically ill secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019¬†(COVID-19), a¬†respiratory tract infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, initially emerged in China in late 2019. The rapid global spread of this novel virus led the World Health Organization declare a¬†pandemic with¬†&gt;¬†30,000,000¬†confirmed cases, 946,000¬†deaths and &gt; 21,000,000¬†recoveries reported as of 18¬†September 2020, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. Initial reports from Asia suggested that elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, specifically diabetes, hypertension, and obesity were at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19¬†following a¬†SARS-CoV-2¬†infection. As data on these risks have evolved, evidence has increasingly shown that patients with cancer are indeed a¬†particularly vulnerable group. However, the effects of various confounding factors, including an older than average patient population who often have underlying comorbidities including a¬†suppressed immune system and/&#8202;or a¬†hypercoagulable state, have been difficult to separate from the effects of having cancer. Common presenting symptoms of SARS-CoV-2¬†including dyspnoea, cough, fever, fatigue, dysgeusia and, less commonly, diarrhoea and/&#8202;or a¬†hyperinflammatory syndrome are equally confusing to clinicians as they all are common symptoms of both cancer and toxicity from anti-cancer therapy. Furthermore, the radiographic dilemma of distinguishing between immune-checkpoint inhibitor-induced pneumonitis from that caused by SARS-CoV-2¬†infection and conflicting data on the effects of certain therapies on patient outcomes has left clinicians with considerable angst on how to help patients with acute or worsening symptoms in an optimal way. Predicted increase in mortality follows not only from the delay in discovery and progress resulting from temporary closing of research laboratories at cancer centers but also from diversion of resources to patient care and temporary suspension of clinical trial enrolment both by companies and local institutions. The possibilities of travelling to specialized medical centers whose activities are essential for the delivery and improvement of patient care were reduced, too. Viral mutations might also occur during transmission and spread; this leads to a¬†statement that SARS-CoV-2¬†will forever remain a¬†looming threat to the oncological community. What is crucial to remember is that cancer itself is a¬†pandemic with¬†&gt;¬†18,000,000¬†people dia-gnosed worldwide every year. Many societies, including the European Society for Medical Oncology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, are providing clinical recommendations for the management of patients with cancer during this challenging time, recognizing that continuation in the precise treatment of our patients is critical for our role of physicians. PURPOSE: The aim of the presentation is to point out the contact or overlapping areas of both mentioned disease entities for the purpose of possible simplification of dia-gnostic and therapeutic management of a¬†cancer patient with suspected or already proven¬† COVID-19¬†disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, appeared in Wuhan, China. This virus is the cause of the COVID-19 disease. This infection later spread to the whole world. The goal of this article is to present the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with COVID-19 treated in the Faculty Hospital Pilsen. METHODS: In this monocentric, retrospective study, clinical and biochemical data of 89 adult patients with COVID-19 was analyzed. These patients were in the care of the Faculty Hospital Pilsen between March 14 and April 7. RESULTS: In this cohort, made up of 89 patients, 63 were treated as outpatients and 26 were hospitalized. 10 patients required intensive care. The most common symptoms among patients were cough and fever. Dyspnea was present in 29 patients. A CT scan showed bilateral pneumonia in 23 of the admitted patients. Fever and bilateral pneumonia were significantly more common in patients ‚â• 60 years old (p=0.047, and p=0.001, respectively). Of lab results, the patients in intensive care had significantly higher values of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin 6, myoglobin and ferritin. CONCLUSION: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and cough. These two symptoms are simultaneously present in more than half the cases. Approximately 1/10th of patients requires intensive care. Higher values of lactate dehydrogenase, myoglobin and ferritin on patient admission appear to be a strong predictive factor of the patient's status progressing into requiring ICU attention.

AB  - Thromboembolic events are frequent in patients with COVID-19 infection, and no cases of bilateral renal infarctions have been reported. We present the case of a 41-year-old female patient with diabetes mellitus and obesity who attended the emergency department for low back pain, respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and shock. The patient had acute kidney injury and required hemodialysis. Contrast abdominal tomography showed bilateral renal infarction and anticoagulation was started. Kidney infarction cases require high diagnostic suspicion and possibility of starting anticoagulation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Assessing the risk factors for and consequences of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during pregnancy is essential to guide clinical care. Previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy have been among hospitalized patients, which may have exaggerated risk estimates of severe outcomes because all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pregnant population were not included. The objectives of this study were to identify risk factors for and outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy independent of severity of infection in a universally tested population, and to identify risk factors for and outcomes after severe infection requiring hospital admission. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective population-based cohort study in Denmark using data from the Danish National Patient Register and Danish Microbiology Database and prospectively registered data from medical records. We included all pregnancies between March 1 and October 31, 2020 and compared women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test during pregnancy to non-infected pregnant women. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy were both identified prospectively and through register linkage to ensure that all cases were identified and that cases were pregnant during infection. Main outcome measures were pregnancy, delivery, maternal, and neonatal outcomes. Severe infection was defined as hospital admission due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms. RESULTS: Among 82¬†682 pregnancies, 418 women had SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, corresponding to an incidence of 5.1 per 1000 pregnancies, 23 (5.5%) of which required hospital admission due to COVID-19. Risk factors for infection were asthma (odds ratio [OR] 2.19, 95% CI 1.41-3.41) and being foreign born (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.70-2.64). Risk factors for hospital admission due to COVID-19 included obesity (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.00-7.51), smoking (OR 4.69, 95% CI 1.58-13.90), infection after gestational age (GA) 22¬†weeks (GA 22-27¬†weeks: OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.16-12.29; GA 28-36¬†weeks: OR 4.76, 95% CI 1.60-14.12), and having asthma (OR 4.53, 95% CI 1.39-14.79). We found no difference in any obstetrical or neonatal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Only 1 in 20 women with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy required admission to hospital due to COVID-19. Risk factors for admission comprised obesity, smoking, asthma, and infection after GA 22¬†weeks. Severe adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy were rare.

AB  - In the recent past, there has been rising attention to systemic racism. The ensuing discussions have largely focused on COVID-19 and policing. Despite long-standing disparities in obesity across racial and ethnic groups and obesity's important role in COVID-19 disparities, there has been minimal attention to whether obesity itself could be a manifestation of systemic racism. Nor has there been serious policy attention dedicated to alleviating obesity and its disproportionate burden on BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color). We discuss whether obesity's disproportionate harms to BIPOC may be attributed to systemic racism, and we provide a ten-point strategy for studying and solving the core public health issues at the intersection of obesity and systemic racism.

AB  - Recent studies report negative mental health effects of the COVID-19 related lockdown measures in general paediatric cohorts. Since obesity is a risk factor for COVID-19 in adults, children (including adolescents) with obesity might perceive themselves to be vulnerable. Using a combined quantitative and qualitative approach, we explored COVID-19 related anxiety in paediatric patients with severe obesity in the Netherlands using semi-structured telephone interviews and the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) questionnaire, which had also been completed by the study population at baseline in the year prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. In total, 75 families participated in the semi-structured telephone interviews during the lockdown, April 2020. Characteristics of included patients were: median age 10.5‚Äâyears (interquartile range = 7.6-15.2); 52% female; mean BMI standard deviation score 3.8 (SD = 1.0). COVID-19 related anxiety was reported for 24/75 (32%) children. The mean decrease in PedsQL score between baseline visit and COVID-19 outbreak did not differ between children for whom anxiety was reported vs those for whom it was not (mean change -10.3‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ36.5 vs -3.3‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ24.4, P = .54). Self-imposed strict quarantine measures were taken by 19/75 (25%) families. During follow-up, several families reported that the previous contact alleviated their anxiety. In conclusion, healthcare professionals should address possible COVID-19 related anxiety in children with severe obesity. Addressing COVID-19 related anxiety could mitigate its potential negative effects.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that was initially described in Wuhan China in December 2019. In the USA (US), the person to be diagnosed with the novel Coronavirus infection (COVID) was on 19 January 2020. On 18 March 2020, a 31-year-old morbidly obese African American woman presented with severe dyspnea with associated hypoxemia, fever and bilateral interstitial pulmonary ground glass infiltrates consistent with viral pneumonitis. Nasopharyngeal PCR testing was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Despite initiation of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin along with supplemental oxygen therapy, rapid disease progression consistent with cytokine release syndrome ensued, leading to initiation of mechanical ventilatory support. Anti-Interleukin (IL)-6 receptor monoclonal antibody (tocilizumab) was administered. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leads to refractory hypoxemia and demise. Severe morbid obesity as well as race may be unidentified risk factors for the development of severe Illness in patients with COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on the delivery of weight management programmes (WMPs), in order to ensure the safety of patients and healthcare professionals. Videoconferencing could provide safe remote access to group WMPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives of this study were to determine the uptake of a virtual group WMP and its predictors. METHODS: All patients enrolled on a face-to-face group WMP, which constitutes part of a Tier 3 WMP delivered by the NHS, at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown were invited to transfer to a virtual format of the group WMP. Baseline data included weight, BMI, age, gender, ethnicity and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) quintile score. The outcomes were accept/decline transfer to the virtual group WMP. Logistic regression was performed to assess for predictors of uptake. RESULTS: The 315 participants were included, of which 72.1% (n¬†=¬†227) accepted. After adjusting for gender, deprivation and BMI; older patients (OR 0.966, [95% CI 0.944, 0.989]; p¬†=¬†0.003) and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity (BAME) patients (OR 0.460 [95% 0.248, 0.851]; p¬†=¬†0.023) were less likely to accept the virtual group WMP. CONCLUSION: Strategies aimed at improving uptake of group WMP among BAME and older adult groups are needed, particularly considering the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in these two groups, and the links between obesity and poor COVID-19 outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current literature on COVID-19 pandemic has identified diabetes as a common comorbidity in patients affected. However, the evidence that diabetes increases the risk of infection, effect of diabetes on outcomes and characteristics of patients at risk is not clear. OBJECTIVES: To explore the prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 pandemic, effect of diabetes on clinical outcomes and to characterise the patients with diabetes affected by COVID-19. METHODS: A literature review of articles published in English language and reported outcomes on prevalence and effect of diabetes on outcomes and patients' characteristics. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 patients appears similar to that in the general population. The evidence of diabetes increasing the risk of severe infection and adverse outcomes is substantial. The progression of the disease into acute respiratory distress syndrome, the requirement for intensive care admission or mechanical ventilation and mortality all have been increased by the presence of diabetes. Patients with diabetes at risk of COVID-19 appear to be obese, of older age, have uncontrolled glycaemia and have coexisting comorbidities especially cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Tight glycaemic control on admission to hospital using insulin infusion has shown some beneficial effects; however, the role of hypoglycaemic medications in the management of these patients is not yet clear. CONCLUSION: High risk group should be identified and prioritised in future vaccination programmes. Future research is required to optimise management of patients with diabetes and develop new ways to manage them via technological developments such as telecare.

AB  - The COVID-19 death toll has involved to date more than 1 million confirmed deaths. The death rate is even higher in the obese COVID-19 patients, as a result of hypoxia, due to the interplay between adipose tissue hypoxia and obstructive sleep apnea. The discrepancy of manifestations seen in COVID-19 seems to be mediated by a differential immune response rather than a differential viral load. One of the key players of the immune response is HIF. HIF-1Œ≤ is a stable constitutively expressed protein in the nucleus; and under hypoxic changes, its activity is unaffected, whereas the HIF-Œ± subunit has a short half-life and because of its degradation by an enzyme known as propyl hydroxylase; under hypoxic conditions, propyl hydroxylase gets deactivated thus leading to the stabilization of HIF-1Œ±. As mentioned before, HIF-1Œ± expression is triggered by hypoxic states, this crippling condition will aggravate the pro-inflammatory characteristics of HIF-1Œ±. The vast majority of decompensated COVID19 cases manifest with drastic lung injury and severe viral pneumonia, the infection-induced hypoxia will the existing hypoxia in obesity. This will additionally augment HIF-1Œ± levels that will provoke the already existing cytokines' storm to fulminant. Consequently, this will directly correlate the effect of a hypoxic environment with the increase of HIF-1Œ± level. HIF…ë exists in two main isoforms HIF-1Œ± and HIF-2Œ±. HIF-1Œ± and HIF-2Œ± act in distinct ways in how they work on different target genes. For example, HIF-2Œ± may act on hemopoietin genes (heme-regulating genes); while HIF-1Œ± acts on EPO. HIF-1Œ± release seems to be markedly augmented in obesity due to adipose tissue hypoxia and obstructive sleep apnea resulting in cyclic hypoxia. HIF-1Œ± can also be secreted by direct viral proteolytic effects. Whereas, HIF-2Œ± is stimulated by chronic hypoxia. HIF-1Œ± exerts detrimental effects on the immune system, characterized by unopposed pro-inflammation at the macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, and complement levels resulting in cytokines' storm, which is linked to the poor outcomes of COVID-19. On the other hand, HIF-2Œ± role is regulatory and largely opposes the actions mediated by HIF-1Œ±. In view of this, inhibiting HIF-1Œ± release or switching its production to HIF-2Œ± by natural products such as resveratrol or by synthetic drugs, offer a good therapeutic strategy that can prevent COVID-19 worst outcome in infected patients. The approach of breaking the vicious circle between lung damage-induced hypoxia and HIF-1Œ± pro-inflammatory stimulant through drugs is considered to be extremely promising as a therapeutic manner to combat further deterioration of COVID19 cases.

AB  - COVID-19 has shown a substantial variation in the rate and severity by which it impacts different demographic groups. Specifically, it has shown a predilection towards obese patients as well as well as other vulnerable groups including predilection of males over females, old age over young age and black races over Caucasian ones. Single cell sequencing studies have highlighted the role of cell polarity and the co-expression of proteases, such as Furin, along with ACE2 in the genesis of coronavirus disease rather than exclusively link tissue involvement with ACE2 levels thought previously. It has also forged a connection between the genetic and immune cellular mechanisms underlying COVID infection and the inflammatory state of obese patients, offering a more accurate explanation as to why obese patients are at increased risk of poor COVID outcomes. These commonalities encompass macrophage phenotype switching, genetic expression switching, and overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, depletion of the regulatory cytokines, in situ T cell proliferation, and T cell exhaustion. These findings demonstrate the necessity of single cell sequencing as a rapid means to identify and treat those who are most likely to need hospital admission and intensive care, in the hopes of precision medicine. Furthermore, this study underlines the use of immune modulators such as Leptin sensitizers, rather than immune suppressors as anti-inflammation therapies to switch the inflammatory response from a drastic immunological type 1 response to a beneficial type 2 effective one.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious illness that has rapidly spread throughout the globe. The seriousness of complications puts significant pressures on hospital resources, especially the availability of ICU and ventilators. Current evidence suggests that COVID-19 pathogenesis majorly involves microvascular injury induced by hypercytokinemia, namely interleukin 6 (IL-6). We recount the suggested inflammatory pathway for COVID-19 and its effects on various organ systems, including respiratory, cardiac, hematologic, reproductive, and nervous organ systems, as well examine the role of hypercytokinemia in the at-risk geriatric and obesity subgroups with upregulated cytokines' profile. In view of these findings, we strongly encourage the conduction of prospective studies to determine the baseline levels of IL-6 in infected patients, which can predict a negative outcome in COVID-19 cases, with subsequent early administration of IL-6 inhibitors, to decrease the need for ICU admission and the pressure on healthcare systems.

AB  - ABO blood groups is a cheap and affordable test that can be immediately retrieved from COVID-19 patients at the diagnosis. There is increasing evidence that non-O blood groups have both higher susceptibility and higher severity of COVID-19 infections. The reason behind such relationship seems elusive. Regarding susceptibility, Non-O individuals have Anti-A antibodies which can prevent viral entry across ACE-2 receptors, moreover, Non-O individuals are at higher risk of autoimmunity, hypercoagulable state, and dysbiosis resulting in an augmented tendency for vascular inflammatory sequelae of COVID-19. We can conclude, on the diagnostic level, that ABO blood groups can be potentially used for risk stratification of affected COVID-19 patients, to anticipate the deterioration of patients at higher risk for complications. On a therapeutic level, plasma from normal O blood group individuals might potentially replace the use of convalescent serum for the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - Furin, a cleavage enzyme, is increasingly recognized in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. Its cleavage action is an essential activation step for the endothelial pathogenicity of several viruses including SARS-CoV-2. This Furin-mediated endothelial tropism seems to underlie the multi-organ system involvement of COVID-19; which is a feature that was not recognized in the older versions of coronaviridae. Obese and diabetic patients, males, and the elderly, have increased serum levels of Furin, with its increased cellular activity; this might explain why these subgroups are at an increased risk of COVID-19 related complications and deaths. In contrast, smoking decreases cellular levels of Furin, this finding may be at the origin of the decreased severity of COVID-19 in smokers. Chinese herbal derived luteolin is suggested to be putative Furin inhibitor, with previous success against Dengue Fever. Additionally, Furin intracellular levels are largely dependent on concentration of intracellular ions, notably sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Consequently, the use of ion channel inhibitors, such as Calcium Channel blockers or Potassium Channel blockers, can prevent cellular transfection early in the course of the illness. Nicotine patches and Colchicine have also been suggested as potential therapies due to Furin mediated inhibition of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND¬†AND¬†OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis. Little is known about the predisposing factors of this infection. The aim of this¬†study was to explore an association between the serum vitamin D level, obesity, and underlying health conditions, as well as¬†the vulnerability to COVID-19 in the Iranian population. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 201 patients with coronavirus infection and 201 controls. Cases and controls were matched for age and gender. The study was carried out for 2 months (February 2020-April 2020) at Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex, Tehran, Iran. Serum 25(OH) vitamin D was measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Information containing age, gender, clinical symptoms, body mass index, computed tomography scan findings, and underlying health conditions related to each participant were elicited from health records. RESULTS: A significant negative correlation (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ.02) was observed between the serum vitamin D level and developing coronavirus infection. Also, the results showed that the COVID-19 cases were more likely to be overweight than the controls (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ.023). Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and respiratory infections were found in 20.89%, 9.65%, and 6.96% of cases, respectively. These underlying health conditions were not significantly different between cases and controls (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ.81). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency and obesity are two main predisposing factors associated with the vulnerability to coronavirus infection in the Iranian population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Covid-19 infection, leukopenia, inflammation, and elevated liver enzymes are found in most patients. Also, vitamin D deficiency attenuate the immune system and predispose a person more susceptible to infection. In this context, we aimed to evaluate vitamin D, Electrolytes, Complete blood count, Liver enzymes, Urea, Creatinine, Albumin, CRP and ESR levels in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 118 patients with Covid-19 who were hospitalized from 2020/2/19 to 2020/4/3 in ICU. Serum levels of electrolytes, liver enzymes, blood factors, urea, creatinine, CRP and ESR as well as anthropometric parameters and serum vitamin D concentration were measured. RESULTS: A total of 118 patients (80 male and 38 female) was enrolled in the study (65.05¬±15.75 years). Only 5.08% of patients had no risk factors and 55.9% had ‚â• 2 risk factors. Diabetes (44.1%) and obesity (23.7%) were more common among patients. Laboratory finding showed that 80.50% of patients had hyponatremia, but other electrolytes included K, Mg, Ca and P were normal in majority of participants as well as CBC, Cr, Urea, Alb, ALT and ALKP. The AST concentration increased in most patients (66.94%). All patients had high levels of inflammatory factors such as CRP and ESR. The mean of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels in participants (25.95 ¬± 14.56 ng/mL) was lower than its levels in general papulation. However, it was not statistically significant (P= 0.88). A significant negative correlation found between vitamin D and ALT (P= 0.02, -0.21) as well as vitamin D and CRP (P= 0.05, -0.17). CONCLUSION: Regarding to the regulatory role of vitamin D in immune system and low levels of vitamin D in Covid-19 infected patients, the evaluation of vitamin D levels and prescribe supplements if necessary is suggested.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Feelings of isolation, insecurity, and instability triggered by COVID-19 could have a long-term impact on the mental health status of individuals. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of mental health symptoms (anxiety, depression, and stress) in Bangladesh and the factors associated with these symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From 1 to 30 April 2020, we used a validated self-administered questionnaire to conduct a cross-sectional study on 10,609 participants through an online survey platform. We assessed mental health status using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The total depression, anxiety, and stress subscale scores were divided into normal, mild, moderate, severe, and multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associated factors. FINDINGS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 15%, 34%, and 15% for mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 59% for severe anxiety symptoms, 14% for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 14% for mild anxiety symptoms, while the prevalence for stress levels were 16% for severe stress level, 22% for moderate stress level, and 13% for mild stress level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the most consistent factors associated with mild, moderate, and severe of the three mental health subscales (depression, anxiety, and stress) were respondents who lived in Dhaka and Rangpur division, females, those who self-quarantined in the previous seven days before the survey, and those respondents who experienced chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, and sore throat. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that about 64%, 87%, and 61% of the respondents in Bangladesh reported high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. There is a need for mental health support targeting women and those who self-quarantined or lived in Dhaka and Rangpur during the pandemic.

AB  - This study investigated the perception and awareness of risk among adult participants in Bangladesh about Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). During the lockdown era in Bangladesh at two different time points, from 26-31 March 2020 (early lockdown) and 11-16 May 2020 (late lockdown), two self-administered online surveys were conducted on 1005 respondents (322 and 683 participants, respectively) via social media. To examine risk perception and knowledge-related factors towards COVID-19, univariate and multiple linear regression models were employed. Scores of mean knowledge (8.4 vs. 8.1, p = 0.022) and perception of risk (11.2 vs. 10.6, p < 0.001) differed significantly between early and late lockdown. There was a significant decrease in perceived risk scores for contracting SARS-Cov-2 [Œ≤ = -0.85, 95%CI: -1.31, -0.39], while knowledge about SARS-Cov-2 decreased insignificantly [Œ≤ = -0.22, 95%CI: -0.46, 0.03] in late lockdown compared with early lockdown period. Self-quarantine was a common factor linked to increased perceived risks and knowledge of SARS-Cov-2 during the lockdown period. Any effort to increase public awareness and comprehension of SARS-Cov-2 in Bangladesh will then offer preference to males, who did not practice self-quarantine and are less worried about the propagation of this kind of virus.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in worldwide research efforts to recognize people at greatest risk of developing critical illness and dying. Growing numbers of reports have connected obesity to more severe COVID-19 illness and death. Although the exact mechanism by which obesity may lead to severe COVID-19 outcomes has not yet been determined, the mechanisms appear to be multifactorial. These include mechanical changes of the airways and lung parenchyma, systemic and airway inflammation, and general metabolic dysfunction that adversely affect pulmonary function and/or response to treatment. As COVID-19 continues to spread worldwide, clinicians should carefully monitor and manage obese patients for prompt and targeted treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide a detailed study of demographic, baseline comorbidities, clinical features, and outcome for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: A record-based case-series study conducted from March 23 to June 15, 2020 in King Saud Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Demographic data, clinical presentation, laboratory investigations, complications, and in-hospital outcome of COVID-19 patients collected with analysis of the clinical characteristics for survivors and deceased. RESULTS: A total of 768 patients were included. The mean age was 46.36¬±13.7 years and 76.7% were men. Approximately 96.3% reported more than one comorbidity; diabetes mellitus was the most frequent (46.4%). Fever (84.5%), cough (82.3%), and shortness of breath (79.8%) were the main presenting symptoms. During the follow-up, pneumonia reported in 68.6%, acute respiratory distress syndrome in 32.7%, septic shock in 20.7%, respiratory failure in 20.3%, and acute kidney injury in 19.3%. Approximately 45.8% of enrolled patients required intensive care unit admission. Lung disease (odd ratio [OR]=3.862 with 95% confident interval [CI] (2.455-6.074), obesity (OR=3.732, CI=2.511-5.546), smoking (OR=2.991, CI=2.072-4.317), chronic kidney disease (OR=2.296. CI=1.497-3.521), and diabetes mellitus (OR=2.291, CI=1.714-3.063) are predictors of ICU admission. Fatality ratio was 4.27%; therefore, men were more prevalent in dead group. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease 2019 places a huge burden on healthcare facilities, particularly in patients with comorbidity. Coronavirus disease 2019 patients who are obese and smokers with history of diabetes mellitus have a high risk of death.

AB  - Background: We sought to investigate the outcomes associated with COVID-19 disease in cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Results: Of the 206 patients included, 57 had at least one preexisting malignancy. Cancer patients were older than noncancer patients. Of the 185 discharged cases, cancer patients had a significantly higher frequency of unplanned reintubation (7.1% vs 0.9%, p¬†<¬†0.049), and required longer hospital stay (8.58¬†¬±¬†6.50¬†days versus 12.83¬†¬±¬†11.44¬†days, p¬†<¬†0.002). Regression analysis revealed that obesity and active smoking were associated with an increased risk of mortality. Conclusion: Outcomes in COVID-19 appear to be driven by obesity as well as active smoking, with no difference in mortality between cancer and noncancer patients.
In this study, we aimed to investigate how COVID-19 affected cancer patients and whether this altered their survival outcomes. To do this, we examined data from a database of patients who have passed through our institution ‚Äì a retrospective cohort analysis. Of the 206 patients we included in the study from this database, 57 had at least one preexisting cancer. Cancer patients tended to be older than noncancer patients. Of the 185 discharged patients, cancer patients required longer hospital stays, but there was no difference in mortality. Disease complications and intensive care unit admission with obesity and active smoking put patients in our cohort at increased risk of death. To conclude, outcomes in COVID-19 patients appear to be driven by obesity as well as active smoking, with no difference in mortality between cancer and noncancer patients.

AB  - The foremost mortality-causing symptom associated with COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A significant correlation has been identified between the deficiency in vitamin D and the risk of developing ARDS. It has been suggested that if we can reduce or modify ARDS in COVID-19 patients, we may significantly reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and associated mortality rates. The increased mortality of dark-skinned people, who have a reduced UV absorption capacity, may be consistent with diminished vitamin D status. The factors associated with COVID-19 mortality, such as old age, ethnicity, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes, are all found to be linked with vitamin D deficiency. Based on this review and as a precautionary measure, it is suggested that the adoption of appropriate and safe solar exposure and vitamin D enriched foods and supplements should be considered to reduce the possible severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Safe sun exposure is deemed beneficial globally, specifically in low and middle-income countries, as there is no cost involved. It is also noted that improved solar exposure and vitamin D levels can reduce the impact of other diseases as well, thus assisting in maintaining general human well-being.

AB  - For almost a year, the major medical problem has been the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. People with diabetes who contract COVID-19 are likely to experience more serious symptoms than patients without diabetes. This article presents new research about the epidemiology of COVID-19 in a group of patients with diabetes. It details the mortality and prognosis in such patients, as well as the relationship between COVID-19 and the diseases most often coexisting with diabetes: obesity, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and increased risk for infection. It also details how the virus infects and affects patients with hyperglycemia. The context of glycation and receptors for advanced glycation products (RAGE) seems to be of particular importance here. We also present a hypothesis related to the cause-and-effect axis-it turns out that diabetes can be both the cause of the more difficult course of COVID-19 and the result of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The last part of this article discusses the impact of antihyperglycemic drugs on the development of COVID-19 and other pharmacological implications, including which non-classical antihyperglycemic drugs seem to be effective in both the treatment of coronavirus infection and glucose homeostasis, and what strategies related to RAGE and glycation should be considered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a newly identified and serious health condition associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical manifestations vary widely among patients with MIS-C, and the aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with severe outcomes. METHODS: In this retrospective surveillance study, patients who met the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition for MIS-C (younger than 21 years, fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, admitted to hospital, multisystem [‚â•2] organ involvement [cardiac, renal, respiratory, haematological, gastrointestinal, dermatological, or neurological], no alternative plausible diagnosis, and either laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, serology, or antigen test, or known COVID-19 exposure within 4 weeks before symptom onset) were reported from state and local health departments to the CDC using standard case-report forms. Factors assessed for potential links to severe outcomes included pre-existing patient factors (sex, age, race or ethnicity, obesity, and MIS-C symptom onset date before June 1, 2020) and clinical findings (signs or symptoms and laboratory markers). Logistic regression models, adjusted for all pre-existing factors, were used to estimate odds ratios between potential explanatory factors and the following outcomes: intensive care unit (ICU) admission, shock, decreased cardiac function, myocarditis, and coronary artery abnormalities. FINDINGS: 1080 patients met the CDC case definition for MIS-C and had symptom onset between March 11 and Oct 10, 2020. ICU admission was more likely in patients aged 6-12 years (adjusted odds ratio 1¬∑9 [95% CI 1¬∑4-2¬∑6) and patients aged 13-20 years (2¬∑6 [1¬∑8-3¬∑8]), compared with patients aged 0-5 years, and more likely in non-Hispanic Black patients, compared with non-Hispanic White patients (1¬∑6 [1¬∑0-2¬∑4]). ICU admission was more likely for patients with shortness of breath (1¬∑9 [1¬∑2-2¬∑9]), abdominal pain (1¬∑7 [1¬∑2-2¬∑7]), and patients with increased concentrations of C-reactive protein, troponin, ferritin, D-dimer, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro B-type BNP, or interleukin-6, or reduced platelet or lymphocyte counts. We found similar associations for decreased cardiac function, shock, and myocarditis. Coronary artery abnormalities were more common in male patients (1¬∑5 [1¬∑1-2¬∑1]) than in female patients and patients with mucocutaneous lesions (2¬∑2 [1¬∑3-3¬∑5]) or conjunctival injection (2¬∑3 [1¬∑4-3¬∑7]). INTERPRETATION: Identification of important demographic and clinical characteristics could aid in early recognition and prompt management of severe outcomes for patients with MIS-C. FUNDING: None.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Adipose tissue is a biologically active organ with pro-immunogenic properties. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) in COVID-19 and its correlation with other inflammatory biomarkers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One-hundred patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-CRP ratio (LCR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were evaluated on admission. EAT volume and density were measured by computed tomography. Patients were followed until death or discharge. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed and ROC curve analysis was used to assess the ability of inflammatory markers in predicting survival. The relationship between EAT and other inflammatory markers was also investigated. RESULTS: The mean¬†¬±¬†SD age of patients was 55.5¬†¬±¬†15.2¬†years old; 68% were male. Univariate analysis revealed that increased lung involvement, blood urea nitrogen, LDH and NLR, and decreased platelet count were significantly associated with death. After adjustment, LDH was independently predictive of death (OR¬†=¬†1.013, p-value¬†=¬†0.03). Among inflammatory markers, LCR had the best ability for predicting survival with 79.7% sensitivity and 64.3% specificity at an optimal cut-off value of 20.8 (AUC¬†=¬†0.744, 95% CI¬†=¬†0.612-0.876, p-value¬†=¬†0.004). EAT volume demonstrated positive correlation with NLR and PLR (p¬†=¬†0.001 and 0.01), and a negative correlation with LCR (p¬†=¬†0.02). EAT density was significantly different between decedents and survivors (p¬†=¬†0.008). CONCLUSION: Routine laboratory tests that represent status of inflammation can be used as cost-effective prognostic markers of COVID-19. Also, the significant association between EAT volume and other inflammatory biomarkers might explain the more severe disease in obese patients.

AB  - COVID-19 is a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2), known as a highly contagious disease, currently affecting more than 200 countries worldwide. The main feature of SARS-CoV-2 that distinguishes it from other viruses is the speed of transmission combined with higher risk of mortality from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). People with diabetes mellitus (DM), severe obesity, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension are more likely to get infected and are at a higher risk of mortality from COVID-19. Among elderly patients who are at higher risk of death from COVID-19, 26.8% have DM. Although the reasons for this increased risk are yet to be determined, several factors may contribute to type-2 DM patients' increased susceptibility to infections. A possible factor that may play a role in increasing the risk in people affected by diabetes and/or obesity is the impaired innate and adaptive immune response, characterized by a state of chronic and low-grade inflammation that can lead to abrupt systemic metabolic alteration. SARS patients previously diagnosed with diabetes or hyperglycemia had higher mortality and morbidity rates when compared with patients who were under metabolic control. Similarly, obese individuals are at higher risk of developing complications from SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we will explore the current and evolving insights pertinent to the metabolic impact of coronavirus infections with special attention to the main pathways and mechanisms that are linked to the pathophysiology and treatment of diabetes.

AB  - Delays in the delivery of bariatric surgery in Canada in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been previously explored. Understanding the potential barriers associated with these delays may help in the implementation and delivery of enhanced bariatric protocols, thereby minimizing health care system burden and improving bariatric delivery. We present the experience of a single high-volume, accredited bariatric program in Edmonton, Alberta, in 2020. Although reductions in bariatric cases occurred during lockdown months, the overall number of cases was comparable to 2019 owing to the adoption of strategies aimed at offsetting the burden of hospital resources. These strategies included optimizing patient selection, implementing bariatric Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols, and minimizing unnecessary postoperative investigations to allow most patients to be discharged on postoperative day 1. We advocate to continue optimizing bariatric delivery in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic that so disproportionally affects those with severe obesity and its metabolic complications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity has been described as a protective factor in cardiovascular and other diseases being expressed as 'obesity paradox'. However, the impact of obesity on clinical outcomes including mortality in COVID-19 has been poorly systematically investigated until now. We aimed to compare clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients divided into three groups according to the body mass index (BMI). METHODS: We retrospectively collected data up to May 31(st), 2020. 3635 patients were divided into three groups of BMI (<25 kg/m(2); n = 1110, 25-30 kg/m(2); n = 1464, and >30 kg/m(2); n = 1061). Demographic, in-hospital complications, and predictors for mortality, respiratory insufficiency, and sepsis were analyzed. RESULTS: The rate of respiratory insufficiency was more recorded in BMI 25-30 kg/m(2) as compared to BMI < 25 kg/m(2) (22.8% vs. 41.8%; p < 0.001), and in BMI > 30 kg/m(2) than BMI < 25 kg/m(2), respectively (22.8% vs. 35.4%; p < 0.001). Sepsis was more observed in BMI 25-30 kg/m(2) and BMI > 30 kg/m(2) as compared to BMI < 25 kg/m(2), respectively (25.1% vs. 42.5%; p = 0.02) and (25.1% vs. 32.5%; p = 0.006). The mortality rate was higher in BMI 25-30 kg/m(2) and BMI > 30 kg/m(2) as compared to BMI < 25 kg/m(2), respectively (27.2% vs. 39.2%; p = 0.31) (27.2% vs. 33.5%; p = 0.004). In the Cox multivariate analysis for mortality, BMI < 25 kg/m(2) and BMI > 30 kg/m(2) did not impact the mortality rate (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.889-1.508; p = 0.27) (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.893-1.479; p = 0.27). In multivariate logistic regression analyses for respiratory insufficiency and sepsis, BMI < 25 kg/m(2) is determined as an independent predictor for reduction of respiratory insufficiency (OR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.538-1.004; p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: HOPE COVID-19-Registry revealed no evidence of obesity paradox in patients with COVID-19. However, Obesity was associated with a higher rate of respiratory insufficiency and sepsis but was not determined as an independent predictor for a high mortality.

AB  - In order to describe manifestations from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), sociodemographic variables such as, previous medical history, clinical and radiological manifestations, treatments and evolution of patients were evaluated. This took place from March 6th to 25th, 2020, in the "Edgardo Rebagliati Martins" National Hospital in Lima. Seventeen patients were registered: 76% were male, with an average age of 53.5 years (range 25-94); 23.5% had returned from abroad; 41.2% were referred from other health facilities; 41.2% were admitted to mechanical ventilation; 29.4% (5 patients) died. The risk factors detected were: advanced age, arterial hypertension and obesity. The main symptoms detected were: cough, fever and dyspnea. Frequent laboratory findings were: elevated C-reactive protein and lymphopenia. The predominant radiological presentation was bilateral interstitial lung infiltrate. A first experience in the management of patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 in Peru is reported.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) has caused significant global morbidity and mortality, especially in persons with underlying cardiovascular disease. There have been concerns that lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) increases angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 levels. Conversely, pleiotropic effects of statins can theoretically protect against severe COVID19 infection, supporting evidence from other respiratory illnesses in which statin use probably confers benefit. RECENT FINDINGS: There is an abundance of studies that show that statins are safe and potentially protect against severe COVID19 infection (critical illness and death), even when adjustment for potential confounders is undertaken. However, the evidence is limited to retrospective cohorts. The benefit for patients with diabetes is less clear. There is a paucity of evidence for other LLT agents. Available clinical guidelines recommend the ongoing use of LLT in patients with COVID19 (unless specifically contra-indicated) and the data from available studies support these. SUMMARY: In patients with COVID19 infection, LLT should be continued. However, the current findings need substantiating in larger prospective clinical studies with specific examination of the possible mechanisms by which LLT confers benefit from COVID19.

AB  - Evidence-based management of analgesia and sedation in COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome remains limited. Non-guideline recommended analgesic and sedative medication regimens and deeper sedation targets have been employed for patients with COVID-19 due to exaggerated analgesia and sedation requirements with extended durations of mechanical ventilation. This, coupled with a desire to minimize nurse entry into COVID-19 patient rooms, marked obesity, altered end-organ function, and evolving medication shortages, presents numerous short- and long-term challenges. Alternative analgesic and sedative agents and regimens may pose safety risks and require judicious bedside management for appropriate use. The purpose of this commentary is to provide considerations and solutions for designing safe and effective analgesia and sedation strategies for adult patients with considerable ventilator dyssynchrony and sedation requirements, such as COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe changes in families' home food environment and parent feeding practices, from before to during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and examine whether changes differed by food security status. METHODS: Parents (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ584) in the US completed a single online survey, reporting on food security, home food availability, and feeding practices both retrospectively (considering before COVID-19) and currently (during COVID-19). œá(2) and univariate regressions examined associations by food security status. RESULTS: The percent of families reporting very low food security increased by 20% from before to during COVID-19 (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). About one-third of families increased the amount of high-calorie snack foods, desserts/sweets, and fresh foods in their home; 47% increased nonperishable processed foods. Concern about child overweight increased during COVID-19, with a greater increase for food-insecure versus food-secure parents (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). Use of restriction, pressure to eat, and monitoring increased, with a greater increase in pressure to eat for parents with food insecurity compared with food-secure parents (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, increases in very low food security and changes in the home food environment and parent feeding practices were observed. Results highlight the need to address negative impacts of COVID-19 on children's obesity risk, particularly among those facing health disparities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The economic impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have drastically increased food insecurity in the United States. Initial data, collected a few months into the pandemic, showed that families, particularly those experiencing food insecurity, reported detrimental changes to their home food environment and parent feeding practices, compared to before COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This follow-up study obtained longitudinal data from a sample of parents in the United States to quantify changes in food security status, the home food environment, and parent feeding practices, from before to across COVID-19 as the pandemic continued to persist. METHODS: Parents (N¬†=¬†433) completed online surveys May (T1) and September (T2) 2020 during COVID-19. Food security, home food environment, and parent feeding practices were reported at each timepoint. At T1, parents also retrospectively reported on these factors pertaining to before COVID-19. Chi square analyses and repeated measure mixed models examined associations among study variables. RESULTS: Low or very low food security increased from before COVID-19 (37%) to T1 (54%) and decreased by T2 (45%). About 30% of families who became food insecure, and 44% who stayed food insecure from T1 to T2, reported a decrease in total food in their home; only 3%-6% who became/stayed food secure reported this decrease. Parents' concern for child overweight and use of monitoring increased from before COVID-19 to T1, and decreased by T2, but remained elevated above pre-COVID-19 values. CONCLUSION: Rates of food insecurity remain high as this pandemic persists. Continued assessment of nutrition-related factors and increased economic supports are critical for families to endure COVID-19 and prevent long-term obesity and health risks.

AB  - Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are hormonally active compounds in the environment that interfere with the body's endocrine system and consequently produce adverse health effects. Despite persistent public health concerns, EDCs remain important components of common consumer products, thus representing ubiquitous contaminants to humans. While scientific evidence confirmed their contribution to the severity of Influenza A virus (H1N1) in the animal model, their roles in susceptibility and clinical outcome of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cannot be underestimated. Since its emergence in late 2019, clinical reports on COVID-19 have confirmed that severe disease and death occur in persons aged ‚â•65 years and those with underlying comorbidities. Major comorbidities of COVID-19 include diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, and kidney and liver diseases. Meanwhile, long-term exposure to EDCs contributes significantly to the onset and progression of these comorbid diseases. Besides, EDCs play vital roles in the disruption of the body's immune system. Here, we review the recent literature on the roles of EDCs in comorbidities contributing to COVID-19 mortality, impacts of EDCs on the immune system, and recent articles linking EDCs to COVID-19 risks. We also recommend methodologies that could be adopted to comprehensively study the role of EDCs in COVID-19 risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study assesses the perceptions and acceptance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination. It also examines its influencing factors among the healthcare workers (HCWs) in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study performed in November and December 2020, a total of 1308 HCWs from two large academic hospitals participated in the Eastern Cape Healthcare Workers Acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 (ECHAS) study. Validated measures of vaccine hesitancy were explored using a questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to identify the determinants of vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: The majority were nurses (45.2%), and at risk for unfavourable Covid-19 outcome, due to obesity (62.9%) and having direct contact with individuals confirmed to have Covid-19 (77.1%). The overall acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was 90.1%, which differed significantly by level of education. Individuals with lower educational attainment (primary and secondary education) and those with prior vaccine refusal were less likely to accept the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, positive perceptions about the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were independently associated with vaccine acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: The high level of acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is reassuring; however, HCWs with a lower level of education and those with prior vaccine refusal should be targeted for further engagements to address their concerns and fears.

AB  - The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has increased significantly over the last few decades mirroring the increase in obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. NAFLD has become one of the most common indications for liver transplantation. The deleterious effects of NAFLD are not isolated to the liver only, for it has been recognized as a systemic disease affecting multiple organs through protracted low-grade inflammation mediated by the metabolic activity of excessive fat tissue. Extrahepatic manifestations of NAFLD such as cardiovascular disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and hypothyroidism have been well described in the literature. In recent years, it has become evident that patients suffering from NAFLD might be at higher risk of developing various infections. The proposed mechanism for this association includes links through hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, alterations in innate immunity, obesity, and vitamin D deficiency. Additionally, a risk independent of these factors mediated by alterations in gut microbiota might contribute to a higher burden of infections in these individuals. In this narrative review, we synthetize current knowledge on several infections including urinary tract infection, pneumonia, Helicobacter pylori, coronavirus disease 2019, and Clostridioides difficile as they relate to NAFLD. Additionally, we explore NAFLD's association with hidradenitis suppurativa.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to highlight the multisystem effects of prone position in ARDS patients with a focus on current findings regarding its use in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Two reviewers comprehensively searched PubMed database for literature regarding pathophysiology and efficacy of prone position in ARDS patients as well as specific data regarding this approach in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Prone positioning is well-documented to improve oxygenation and cardiac function in ARDS patients and might confer increased survival, with benefits that outweigh risks such as facial edema, endotracheal tube displacement, and intraabdominal organ dysfunction in obese patients. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia, while meeting ARDS criteria, differs from typical ARDS in several ways. Data would suggest that advantages of prone position would become limited after significant disease progression and fibrosis. The use of this technique in COVID-19 requires prolonged sessions that are unprecedented in the treatment of ARDS patients. New data regarding COVID-19 pathophysiology and patients continues to evolve daily. More frequently, patients are proned while maintaining spontaneous breathing-the results of this intervention are an area for future studies. There is more to learn about the appropriate use of prone position in COVID-19 patients. The multisystem risks and benefits require clinicians to adopt a patient centered decision-making algorithm when employing this technique in COVID-19 patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA.

AB  - In this current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)¬†caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), many studies have been published to determine the spectrum of illness, risk factors, prevention, and treatment strategies. Due to relatively fewer cases among children as compared to adults, there is a paucity of clinical data available to fully understand the risk factors and disease course in the pediatric population. Our understanding is evolving with limited data showing an increased risk of severe or critical disease in children¬†less than one year of age and those with certain underlying medical conditions. Recognition of emerging risk factors for morbidity and mortality is now paramount, to anticipate and provide appropriate clinical care specific to the pediatric population. Obesity has only recently been identified as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease in children. Case reports such as this are essential in understanding the pathophysiologic association, associated disease severity, and clinical outcome attributed to obesity and COVID-19 infections in children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Strict isolation measures and interrupted health care services during the COVID 19 pandemic are contemplated to instigate stress universally, particularly in those with chronic illnesses such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational study was done to assess determinants of stress and its impact on glycemic control in adolescents and young adults (aged 12-24¬†years) living with T1D in India. An online, semi-structured survey including Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) was distributed and results were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 89 participants (46 males, mean age 19.61‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3.8¬†years) with T1D completed the survey. Age (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.325, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.005) and HBA1C level within the preceding 3¬†months (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.274, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.036) correlated positively with PSS-10 scores. There was a statistically significant difference in PSS-10 score based on gender (t(70)‚Äâ=‚Äâ-‚Äâ2.147; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.035), education (F (4,67)‚Äâ=‚Äâ4.34, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.003), and occupation (F(3,68)‚Äâ=‚Äâ4.50, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ.006). On multiple linear regression, gender, occupation, and HbA1C were the significant determinants of PSS-10 (F(3,55)‚Äâ=‚Äâ12.01, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001, R (2)‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.363). One-way ANOVA showed a significant impact of mean PSS-10 score on the glycemic control (F(2,69)‚Äâ=‚Äâ3.813, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.027). CONCLUSION: An increased prevalence of stress was seen among Indian adolescents and young adults living with T1D. Female gender, salaried individuals, and pre-existing poorly controlled diabetes contributed to an increased risk of stress. Increased stress resulted in worsened glycemic control.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether HbA(1c), outpatient diabetes treatment regimen, demographics, and clinical characteristics are associated with mortality in hospitalized patients with diabetes and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of patients with diabetes hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection from 11 March to 7 May 2020 at a large academic medical center in New York City. Multivariate modeling was used to assess the independent association of HbA(1c) levels and outpatient diabetes treatment regimen with mortality, in addition to independent effects of demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: We included 1,126 hospitalized patients with diabetes and COVID-19 for analysis, among whom mean age was 68 years, 50% were male, 75% were Black, mean BMI was 30 kg/m(2), 98% had type 2 diabetes, mean HbA(1c) was 7.5%, and 33.1% died. HbA(1c) levels were not associated with mortality in unadjusted or adjusted analyses, but an outpatient regimen with any insulin treatment was strongly predictive. Additionally, age, sex, and BMI interacted such that in all age categories, mortality was higher with increasing BMI in males compared with females. CONCLUSIONS: In this large U.S. cohort of hospitalized patients with diabetes and COVID-19, insulin treatment, as a possible proxy for diabetes duration, and obesity rather than long-term glycemic control were predictive of mortality. Further investigation of underlying mechanisms of mortality and inpatient glycemic control is needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to cause major mortality and morbidity worldwide even after a year of its emergence. In its early days, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases were noted as poor prognostic factors, while obesity gained attention at a later stage. In the present study, unfavorable clinical outcomes (transfer to the intensive care unit, invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality) were investigated in obese patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study we analyzed patients with positive polymerase chain reaction test in tertiary care hospital between March-May 2020. They were divided into 3 groups according to body mass index (BMI) as normal, overweight, and obese (BMI: 18.5 - 24.99 kg/m¬≤, 25 - 29.99 kg/m¬≤, and ‚â• 30 kg/m¬≤, respectively). We compared clinical features and laboratory findings of these groups and recorded adverse clinical outcomes. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed for unfavorable outcomes. RESULTS: There were 99 patients (35%), 116 (41%), and 69 patients (24%) in the normal-weight, overweight, and obese group, respectively. Among all patients, 52 (18%) patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), 30 (11%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and 22 patients (8%) died. Obese patients had minimum 1 more comorbidity than normal BMI patients (73% vs. 50%, P = 0.002), and a longer median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of hospitalization (8 [5 - 12] vs. 6 [5 - 9]) days, P = 0.006). Obese participants had higher concentrations of serum C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin than non-obese patients (P <0.05 in all). In a multivariate analysis, obesity was associated with ICU admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.99, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.26 - 7.04, P = 0.012). Moreover, IMV requirement was associated with obesity (aOR: 8.73, 95% CI: 2.44 - 31.20, P = 0.001). Mortality occurred in 16%, 9%, and 1% of the obese group, overweight group, and normal-weight group, respectively (Chi-square trend analysis, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Obesity is a risk factor for adverse outcomes and caused increased mortality, hence requiring close follow-up.

AB  - Bariatric and metabolic surgery (BMS), the only effective option for patients with obesity with or without comorbidities, has been stopped temporarily due to the ongoing novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. However, there has been a recent change in the governmental strategy of dealing with this virus from 'Stay at Home' to 'Stay Alert' in many countries including India. A host of health services including elective surgeries are being resumed. In view of the possibility of resumption of BMS in near future, Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society of India (OSSI) constituted a committee of experienced surgeons to give recommendations about the requirements as well as precautions to be taken to restart BMS with emphasis on safe delivery and high-quality care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that obesity is associated with the severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We reviewed clinical studies to clarify the obesity relationship with COVID-19 severity, comorbidities, and discussing possible mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The electronic databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, were searched and all studies conducted on COVID-19 and obesity were reviewed. All studies were independently screened by reviewers based on their titles and abstracts. RESULTS: Forty relevant articles were selected, and their full texts were reviewed. Obesity affects the respiratory and immune systems through various mechanisms. Cytokine and adipokine secretion from adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state in obese patients, predisposing them to thrombosis, incoordination of innate and adaptive immune responses, inadequate antibody response, and cytokine storm. Obese patients had a longer virus shedding. Obesity is associated with other comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and vitamin D deficiency. Hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and even mortality in obese patients were higher than normal-weight patients. Obesity could alter the direction of severe COVID-19 symptoms to younger individuals. Reduced physical activity, unhealthy eating habits and, more stress and fear experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic may result in more weight gain and obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity should be considered as an independent risk factor for the severity of COVID-19. Paying more attention to preventing weight gain in obese patients with COVID-19 infection in early levels of disease is crucial during this pandemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of third-generation iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) in dual-source, high-pitch chest CT protocol with spectral shaping at 100 kVp in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Confirmed COVID-19 inpatients undergoing to unenhanced chest CT were scanned with a dual-energy acquisition (DECT, 90/150Sn kV) and a dual-source, high-pitch acquisition with tin-filtered 100¬†kVp (LDCT). On the DECT with ADMIRE 3 (DECT3) were evaluated the pulmonary findings and their extension (25-point score). Two radiologists in consensus evaluated with 5-point scales the overall image quality, the anatomical structures, and¬†the elementary findings on LDCT reconstructed with filtered backprojection (LDCT0), with ADMIRE 3 (LDCT3) and 5 (LDCT5), and on DECT3. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the body mass index, the¬†exposure times, and the¬†radiation doses were recorded. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients (57¬†M/18F; median age: 63 y.o.) were included, with median pulmonary extension of 13/25 points. The imaging findings were detected in proportion comparable to the available literature. The ADMIRE significantly improved the SNR in LDCT (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.00001) with almost no significant differences in overweight patients. The LDCT had median effective dose of 0.39¬†mSv and acquisition time of 0.71¬†s with significantly less motion artifacts than DECT (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.00001). The DECT3 and LDCT3 provided the best image quality and depiction of pulmonary anatomy and imaging findings, with significant differences among all the series (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.00001). CONCLUSION: The LDCT with spectral shaping and ADMIRE3 provided acceptable image quality in the evaluation of patients with COVID-19, with significantly reduced radiation dose and motion artifacts.

AB  - In the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, only few data regarding lung pathology induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is available, especially without medical intervention interfering with the natural evolution of the disease. We present here the first case of forensic autopsy of a COVID-19 fatality occurring in a young woman, in the community. Diagnosis was made at necropsy and lung histology showed diffuse alveolar damage, edema, and interstitial pneumonia with a geographically heterogeneous pattern, mostly affecting the central part of the lungs. This death related to COVID-19 pathology highlights the heterogeneity and severity of central lung lesions after natural evolution of the disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine (1) factors linked to hospitalizations among managed care patients (MCPs), (2) outcome improvement with use of outpatient off-label treatment, and (3) outcome comparison between MCPs and a mirror group. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study comparing MCPs with an age- and gender-matched mirror group in Florida from April 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020. METHODS: A total of 38,193 MCPs in a Florida primary care group were monitored for COVID-19 incidence, hospitalization, and mortality. The highest-risk patients were managed by the medical group's COVID-19 Task Force. As part of a population health program, the COVID-19 Task Force contacted patients, conducted medical encounters, and tracked data including comorbidities and medical outcomes. The MCPs enrolled in the medical group were compared with a mirror group from the state of Florida. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age among the MCPs was 67.9 (15.2) years, and 60% were female. Older age and hypertension were the most important factors in predicting COVID-19. Obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) were linked to higher rates of hospitalizations. Patients prescribed off-label outpatient medications had 73% lower likelihood of hospitalization (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ.05). Compared with the mirror group, MCPs had 60% lower COVID-19 mortality (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ.05). CONCLUSIONS: MCPs have risk factors similar to the general population for COVID-19 incidence and progression, including older age, hypertension, obesity, CHF, and CKD. Outpatient treatment with off-label medicines decreased hospitalizations. A comprehensive population health program decreased COVID-19 mortality.

AB  - There has been limited study of Native American whole genome diversity to date, which impairs effective implementation of personalized medicine and a detailed description of its demographic history. Here we report high coverage whole genome sequencing of 76 unrelated individuals, from 27 indigenous groups across Mexico, with more than 97% average Native American ancestry. On average, each individual has 3.26 million Single Nucleotide Variants and short indels, that together comprise a catalog of 9,737,152 variants, 44,118 of which are novel. We report 497 common Single Nucleotide Variants (with allele frequency > 5%) mapped to drug responses and 316,577 in enhancer or promoter elements; interestingly we found some of these enhancer variants in PPARG, a nuclear receptor involved in highly prevalent health problems in Mexican population, such as obesity, diabetes, and insulin resistance. By detecting signals of positive selection we report 24 enriched key pathways under selection, most of them related to immune mechanisms. No missense variants in ACE2, the receptor responsible for the entry of the SARS CoV-2 virus, were found in any individual. Population genomics and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated stratification in a Northern-Central-Southern axis, with major substructure in the Central region. The Seri, a northern group with the most genetic divergence in our study, showed a distinctive genomic context with the most novel variants, and the most population specific genotypes. Genome-wide analysis showed that the average haplotype blocks are longer in Native Mexicans than in other world populations. With this dataset we describe previously undetected population level variation in Native Mexicans, helping to reduce the gap in genomic data representation of such groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have recently addressed factors associated with severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, some medications and comorbidities have yet to be evaluated in a large matched cohort. We therefore explored the role of relevant comorbidities and medications in relation to the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. METHODS: All ICU COVID-19 patients in Sweden until 27 May 2020 were matched to population controls on age and gender to assess the risk of ICU admission. Cases were identified, comorbidities and medications were retrieved from high-quality registries. Three conditional logistic regression models were used for risk of ICU admission and three Cox proportional hazards models for risk of ICU mortality, one with comorbidities, one with medications and finally with both models combined, respectively. RESULTS: We included 1981 patients and 7924 controls. Hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, asthma, obesity, being a solid organ transplant recipient and immunosuppressant medications were independent risk factors of ICU admission and oral anticoagulants were protective. Stroke, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors (RAASi) were independent risk factors of ICU mortality in the pre-specified primary analyses; treatment with statins was protective. However, after adjusting for the use of continuous renal replacement therapy, RAASi were no longer an independent risk factor. CONCLUSION: In our cohort oral anticoagulants were protective of ICU admission and statins was protective of ICU death. Several comorbidities and ongoing RAASi treatment were independent risk factors of ICU admission and ICU mortality.

AB  - Throughout history, the human race has often faced pandemics with substantial numbers of fatalities. As the COVID-19 pandemic has now affected the whole planet, even countries with moderate to strong healthcare support and expenditure have struggled to contain disease transmission and casualties. Countries affected by COVID-19 have different demographics, socioeconomic, and lifestyle health indicators. In this context, it is important to find out to what extent these parametric variations are modulating disease outcomes. To answer this, this study selected demographic, socioeconomic, and health indicators e.g., population density, percentage of the urban population, median age, health expenditure per capita, obesity, diabetes prevalence, alcohol intake, tobacco use, case fatality of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as independent variables. Countries were grouped according to these variables and influence on dependent variables e.g., COVID-19 positive tests, case fatality, and case recovery rates were statistically analyzed. The results suggested that countries with variable median age had a significantly different outcome on positive test rate (P < 0.01). Both the median age (P = 0.0397) and health expenditure per capita (P = 0.0041) showed a positive relation with case recovery. An increasing number of tests per 100 K of the population showed a positive and negative relationship with the number of positives per 100 K population (P = 0.0001) and the percentage of positive tests (P < 0.0001), respectively. Alcohol intake per capita in liter (P = 0.0046), diabetes prevalence (P = 0.0389), and NCDs mortalities (P = 0.0477) also showed a statistical relation to the case fatality rate. Further analysis revealed that countries with high healthcare expenditure along with high median age and increased urban population showed more case fatality but also had a better recovery rate. Investment in the health sector alone is insufficient in controlling the severity of the pandemic. Intelligent and sustainable healthcare both in urban and rural settings and healthy lifestyle acquired immunity may reduce disease transmission and comorbidity induced fatalities, respectively.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Our area, corona (COVID-19) quarantine was applied from March 14 to April 23, 2020. It was in all forms, including curfew, social distancing, self-quarantine, area quarantine, self-monitoring, and isolation. Due to their concerns about their safety and families, friends, colleagues, and society, everybody was feeling upset, fearful, and anxious. Several studies have reported an association between prolonged sitting time and weight gain. As a way to relieve the tension during that period, people started stocking up on unhealthy foods like over-salted snacks and over-sweetened sugars. People stayed at home, feeling bored, anxious, and stressed and sought relief by eating. Also, there was a rise in emotional eating when the stress of isolation increased by the closure of gyms, casinos, and movie theaters. Moreover, restaurants were allowed to serve the only takeout. Besides, unemployment was skyrocketing, hospitals were overflowing (or were preparing for the possibility), many people were struggling to meet their basic needs, and no one knows when or how it would end. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to figure out whether social isolation during the COVID-19 quarantine is consistent and associated with emotional eating and gaining weight or not. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional case series study was conducted on 765 patients who have visited the bariatric clinic in Sulaimani city, Kurdistan-Iraq, from April 23 to June 23, 2020. An individual face-to-face interview was conducted with each participant to obtain signed informed consent, provide them with information about the type and the subject of the work, and ask them the study's questions. Each interview lasted between 30 and 45¬†min and was conducted in a closed session by two Kurdistan Board trainees. RESULTS: No patient who was quarantined for the COVID-19 was included in the work, but all other patients were included. The selected patients were those who had undergone social distancing (n¬†=¬†568, 82.48%) by the local law and did self-isolation (n¬†=¬†134, 17.51%) at home for reasons like having comorbidity, being prone to contamination due to their jobs (health, police, and media workers), having some family members at home with comorbidity (n¬†=¬†23, 03.00%), and having comorbidity and having undergone social distancing because of their other family members' need to do so for their physical disability (n¬†=¬†25, 03.27%). Almost all patients (n¬†=¬†741, 96.86%), even, those with comorbidity (n¬†=¬†136, 17.78%), were emotionally stable before the outbreak. Seventy-three female patients (09.54%) and138 males (20.65%) sustain their weight during and two months after the outbreak, while the rest (n¬†=¬†554, 72.41%) gained different amounts of weight. CONCLUSION: Social distancing and self-isolation in the last COVID-19 outbreak influenced weight gain, but weight gain of less than 2¬†kg was observed among almost all patients who gained weight (98.05%). The patients who were gain more than 3¬†kg were mostly females or/and from the center of large cities.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic, affecting all the individuals across the planet. COVID-19 has gained significant attention due to its high prevalence among individuals with diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and metabolic syndrome. NAFLD is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and can be associated with a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The association of COVID-19 and NAFLD has also gained more attention because NAFLD is highly associated with the epidemic of obesity. NAFLD is a potential risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19, independent of metabolic syndrome. Importantly, it is not yet clear whether the epidemics of obesity and NAFLD have perpetuated the current pandemic of COVID-19. Further research is urgently needed to assess the following: (1) Whether NAFLD is a high risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection; (2) Whether NAFLD is associated with the severe form of COVID-19; and (3) Whether the presence of NAFLD can explain the racial variation in the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. This review summarizes the interactions between COVID-19 and NAFLD, mechanism of liver injury by COVID-19, and effect of lockdown due to COVID- 19 on patients with NAFLD.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, the data of Department of Health in United Kingdom (UK) showed an increase mortality and morbidity among the Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) population. This high mortality can be due to social factors, genetic and immunological factors. Metabolic factors like high prevalence of diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome and hypertension were also found to contribute to the increased risk of COVID-19 infection in BAME population. In addition, a large number of BAME population are working in jobs that involve regular and daily contact with public, and this may increase risk of encountering COVID-19 infection. Therefore, future research should address all these factors and generate the correct health policy that will allow us to combat the danger of COVID-19. We recommend the establishment of BAME alliance against COVID-19 in order to improve occupational risks and hazards, adequate income protection, culturally and linguistically appropriate public health communications and decreasing barriers in accessing healthcare. The BAME alliance will initially focus on (i) development of central system to record data about COVID-19 patients from BAME population (ii) involvement of healthcare professionals and researchers from ethnic minorities and (iii) multidisciplinary and inter-institution collaboration; for example, civil engineers and architects¬†need to think about house design and ventilation that decrease risk of COVID-19 especially in BAME populations.

AB  - Comorbidities in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) not only increase morbidity and mortality but also confound disease activity, limit drug usage and increase chances of severe infections or drug-associated adverse effects. Most RMDs lead to accelerated atherosclerosis and variable manifestations of the metabolic syndrome. Literature on COVID-19 in patients with RMDs, and the effects of various comorbidities on COVID-19 was reviewed. The initial data of COVID-19 infections in RMDs have not shown an increased risk for severe disease or the use of different immunosuppression. However, there are some emerging data that patients with RMDs and comorbidities may fare worse. Various meta-analyses have reiterated that pre-existing hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, lung disease or obesity predispose to increased COVID-19 mortality. All these comorbidities are commonly encountered in the various RMDs. Presence of comorbidities in RMDs pose a greater risk than the RMDs themselves. A risk score based on comorbidities in RMDs should be developed to predict severe COVID-19 and death. Additionally, there should be active management of such comorbidities to mitigate these risks. The pandemic must draw our attention towards, and not away from, comorbidities.

AB  - Fasting in the Islamic month of Ramadan is obligatory for all sane, healthy adult Muslims. The length of the day varies significantly in temperate regions-typically lasting‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ18¬†h during peak summer in the UK. The synodic nature of the Islamic calendar means that Ramadan migrates across all four seasons over an approximately‚Äâ33-year cycle. Despite valid exemptions, there is an intense desire to fast during this month, even among those who are considered to be at high risk, including many individuals with diabetes mellitus. In this review we explore the current scientific and clinical evidence on fasting in patients with diabetes mellitus, focussing on type 2 diabetes mellitus and type 1 diabetes mellitus, with brief reviews on pregnancy, pancreatic diabetes, bariatric surgery, the elderly population and current practice guidelines. We also make recommendations on the management of diabetes patients during the month of Ramadan. Many patients admit to a do-it-yourself approach to diabetes mellitus management during Ramadan, largely due to an under-appreciation of the risks and implications of the rigors of fasting on their health. Part of the issue may also lie with a healthcare professional's perceived inability to grasp the religious sensitivities of Muslims in relation to disease management. Thus, the pre-Ramadan assessment is crucial to ensure a safe Ramadan experience. Diabetes patients can be risk-stratified from low, medium to high or very high risk during the pre-Ramadan assessment and counselled accordingly. Those who are assessed to be at high to very high risk are advised not to fast. The current COVID-19 pandemic upgrades those in the high-risk category to very high risk; hence a significant number of diabetes patients may fall under the penumbra of the 'not to fast' advisory. We recognize that fasting is a personal choice and if a person chooses to fast despite advice to the contrary, he/she should be adequately supported and monitored closely during Ramadan and for a brief period thereafter. Current advancements in insulin delivery and glucose monitoring technologies are useful adjuncts to strategies for supporting type 1 diabetes patients considered to be high risk as well as 'high-risk' type 2 patients manage their diabetes during Ramadan. Although there is a lack of formal trial data, there is sufficient evidence across the different classes of therapeutic hypoglycaemic agents in terms of safety and efficacy to enable informed decision-making and provide a breadth of therapeutic options for the patient and the healthcare professional, even if the professional advice is to abstain. Thus, Ramadan provides an excellent opportunity for patient engagement to discuss important aspects of management, to improve control in the short term during Ramadan and to help the observants understand that the metabolic gains achieved during Ramadan are also sustainable in the other months of the year by maintaining a dietary and behavioural discipline. The application of this understanding can potentially prevent long-term complications.

AB  - Aim: International health authorities suggest that individuals aged 65 years and above and people with underlying comorbidities such as hypertension, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and obesity are at increased risk of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, the prevalence of risk factors is unknown in many countries. Therefore, we aim to describe the distribution of these risk factors across Europe. Subject and Methods: Prevalence of risk factors for severe COVID-19 was identified based on interview for 73,274 Europeans aged 50+ participating in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) in 2017. Burden of disease was estimated using population data from Eurostat. Results: A total of 75.3% of the study population (corresponding to app. 60 million European men and 71 million women) had at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19, 45.9% (app. 36 million men and 43 million women) had at least two factors and 21.2% (app. 17 million men and 20 million women) had at least three risk factors. The prevalences of underlying medical conditions ranged from 4.5% for cancer to 41.4% for hypertension, and the region-specific prevalence of having at least three risk factors ranged from 18.9% in Northern Europe to 24.6% in Eastern Europe. Conclusions: Information about the prevalences of risk factors might help authorities to identify the most vulnerable subpopulations with multiple risk factors of severe COVID-19 disease and thus to decide appropriate strategies to mitigate the pandemic.

AB  - The pandemic of COVID-19 has spread from China to the whole world. Here we address the vulnerability of African children in the context of this health crisis. Based on medical, socio-economic and anthropological studies, we present a thematic review that examines the issue at three levels. Firstly, we address the question of the effect of the virus on children in regard to strategies implemented to limit its spread and the capacity of medical devices in Africa. Second, we address the issue of the additional disruptions that the virus could generate by infecting the parents or guardians of children who often find themselves subject to the disquietudes of an informal economy. Finally, we discuss the long-term effects of the crisis on children about food security issues, particularly in relation to overweight and obesity. Based on studies that have documented the long-term overweight risks that can occur due to school cessation as a result of lockdown measures, we provide strategies to address this emerging public health problem in Africa. We conclude the study by suggesting that all these forms of vulnerabilities remain proactive areas of work to better prepare Africa for future pandemics.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) now affects one-seventh of the world's population. Treatment of even mild OSA can improve daytime sleepiness and quality of life. Recent modifications to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty may make it a more widely applicable treatment option in selected patients with OSA. Diet and exercise have effects on sleep apnoea severity independent of weight loss. Insomnia has become increasingly common during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

AB  - The current Coronavirus disease outbreak requires that physicians work in collaboration with other physicians especially in intensive care and emergency units. To fight against this new disease, whose pathogenesis, effects, and results have not been clearly demonstrated, especially in patients with the pre-existing chronic disease, requires special expertise and perspectives. Due to the need for dynamic glucocorticoid treatment at different stages of the disease in patients with adrenal insufficiency, the existence of reports indicating that "coronavirus disease 2019" also affects the adrenal reserve, and the use of glucocorticoids also in advanced stages in patients with Coronavirus disease require this issue to be emphasized with precision. Herein, treatment of the pre-existing adrenal insufficiency in patients with actual Coronavirus disease and the effects of the this critical disease on the adrenal gland have been reviewed.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory distress coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is a rapidly evolving pandemic challenging the world and posing unprecedented public health issues. Current data show that COVID-19 is associated with increased disease severity in individuals with obesity. Obesity is usually associated with dysregulated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) axis. RAAS has also been implicated in acute lung injury as well as myocardial injury and has thus attracted interest as a potential regulator of COVID-19 severity. Whilst research all over the world is still struggling to provide a detailed characterization of the biology of SARS-CoV2 and its associated disease profile, it has become evident that SARS-CoV2 uses the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cell internalization. ACE2 is a protective component of the RAAS axis and is downregulated after SARS-CoV2 infection. The RAAS axis could thus be a link between obesity and COVID-19 severity; therefore, more accurate understanding of the underlying mechanisms would be needed with the hope of proposing efficient therapeutic interventions.

AB  - COVID-19 is an outbreak of viral pneumonia which became a global health crisis, and the risk of morbidity and mortality of people with obesity are higher. SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen of COVID-19, enters into cells through binding to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) homolog-2 (ACE2). ACE2 is a regulator of two contrary pathways in renin angiotensin system (RAS): ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis and ACE2-Ang 1-7-Mas axis. Viral entry process eventuates in downregulation of ACE2 and subsequent activation of ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis. ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis increases lipid storage, reduces white-to-beige fat conversion and plays role in obesity. Conversely, adipose tissue is an important source of angiotensin, and obesity results in increased systemic RAS. ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis, which has proinflammatory, profibrotic, prothrombotic, and vasoconstrictive effects, is potential mechanism of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The link between obesity and severe COVID-19 may be attributed to ACE2 consumption and subsequent ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis activation. Therefore, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may benefit from therapeutic strategies that activate ACE2-Ang 1-7-Mas axis, such as Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs), ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), Mas receptor agonists and ACE2.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) presents primarily with respiratory symptoms. However, extra respiratory manifestations are being frequently recognized including gastrointestinal involvement. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal perforation in association with COVID-19 is rarely reported in the literature. PATIENT CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSIS: In this series, we are reporting 3 cases with different presentations of gastrointestinal perforation in the setting of COVID-19. Two patients were admitted with critical COVID-19 pneumonia, both required intensive care, intubation and mechanical ventilation. The first one was an elderly gentleman who had difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation and required tracheostomy. During his stay in intensive care unit, he developed Candidemia without clear source. After transfer to the ward, he developed lower gastrointestinal bleeding and found by imaging to have sealed perforated cecal mass with radiological signs of peritonitis. The second one was an obese young gentleman who was found incidentally to have air under diaphragm. Computed tomography showed severe pneumoperitoneum with cecal and gastric wall perforation. The third case was an elderly gentleman who presented with severe COVID-19 pneumonia along with symptoms and signs of acute abdomen who was confirmed by imaging to have sigmoid diverticulitis with perforation and abscess collection. INTERVENTIONS: The first 2 cases were treated conservatively. The third one was treated surgically. OUTCOME: Our cases had a variable hospital course but fortunately all were discharged in a good clinical condition. CONCLUSION: Our aim from this series is to highlight this fatal complication to clinicians in order to enrich our understanding of this pandemic and as a result improve patients' outcome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obesity has been described as a significant independent risk factors of COVID-19. We aimed to study the association between obesity, co-morbidities and clinical outcomes of COVID-19. METHODS: Clinical data from 417 patients were collected retrospectively from the Al Kuwait Hospital, Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP), Dubai, United Arab Emirates, who were admitted between March and June 2020. Patients were divided according to their body mass index (BMI). Various clinical outcomes were examined: presenting symptoms, severity, major co-morbidities, ICU admission, death, ventilation, ARDS, septic shock and laboratory parameters. RESULTS: The average BMI was 29¬†¬±¬†6.2¬†kg/m(2). BMI alone was not associated with the outcomes examined. However, class II obese patients had more co-morbidities compared to other groups. Hypertension was the most significant co-morbidity associated with obesity. Patients with BMI above the average BMI (29¬†kg/m(2)) and presence of underlying co-morbidities showed significant increase in admission to ICU compared to patients below 29¬†kg/m(2) and underlying co-morbidities (21.7% Vs. 9.2%), ARDS development (21.7% Vs. 10.53%), need for ventilation (8.3% Vs. 1.3%), and mortality (10% Vs. 1.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that presence of underlying co-morbidities and high BMI work synergistically to affect the clinical outcomes of COVID-19.

AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Age, smoking, obesity, and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes have been described as risk factors for severe complications and mortality in COVID-19. Obesity and diabetes are usually associated with dysregulated lipid synthesis and clearance, which can initiate or aggravate pulmonary inflammation and injury. It has been shown that for viral entry into the host cell, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors present on the cells. We aimed to characterize how SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates lipid metabolism pathways in the host and the effect of dysregulated lipogenesis on the regulation of ACE2, specifically in obesity. In our study, through the re-analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data, we first found that lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed upregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, including the SOC3 gene, which is involved in the regulation of inflammation and inhibition of leptin signaling. This is of interest as viruses may hijack host lipid metabolism to allow the completion of their viral replication cycles. Furthermore, a dataset using a mouse model of diet-induced obesity showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lungs, which negatively correlated with the expression of genes that code for sterol response element-binding proteins 1 and 2 (SREBP). Suppression of Srebp1 showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lung. Moreover, ACE2 expression in human subcutaneous adipose tissue can be regulated through changes in diet. Validation of the in silico data revealed a higher expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and SREBP1 in vitro in lung epithelial cells from obese subjects compared to non-obese subjects. To our knowledge this is the first study to show upregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in obesity. In silico and in vitro results suggest that the dysregulated lipogenesis and the subsequently high ACE2 expression in obese patients might be the mechanism underlying the increased risk for severe complications in those patients when infected by SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Obese patients have an increased risk of COVID-19 critical illness leading to ICU admission or death compared to normal weight individuals. SARS-CoV-2 binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is a critical step mediate virus entry into target cells. Articles have alluded that the level of ACE2 gene expression in adipose tissue is higher than lung tissue, but a PubMed search found no results in articles to demonstrate this. The aim of this study was to investigate ACE2 gene expression in adipose tissue and lung tissue using a public database. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A search of a public gene expression database to investigate ACE2 gene expression in human tissues. RESULTS: ACE2 gene expression was present in both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues. The gene expression profile demonstrated that ACE2 gene expression was higher in human visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues than human lung tissue. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that ACE2 gene expression is higher in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue than that in lung tissue, a major target tissue affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This suggests a mechanism by which excess adiposity may drive greater infection severity in patients with COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D status in patients with COVID-19 is an on-going controversial issue. This study aims to determine differences in the serum 25(OH)D concentrations of Arab Gulf adult residents screened for SARS-CoV-2 and its association with risk of COVID-19 infection together with other comorbidities. METHODS: In this multi-center, case-control study, a total of 220 male and female adults presenting with none to mild symptoms were screened for COVID-19 (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ138 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive and 82 negative controls). Medical history was noted. Anthropometrics were measured and non-fasting blood samples were collected for the assessment of glucose, lipids, inflammatory markers and serum 25(OH)D concentrations. RESULTS: Serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in the SARS-CoV-2 positive group compared to the negative group after adjustment for age and BMI (52.8¬†nmol/l‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ11.0 versus 64.5¬†nmol/l‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ11.1; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.009). Being elderly (>‚Äâ60¬†years) [Odds ratio 6 (95% Confidence Interval, CI 2-18; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001) as well as having type 2 diabetes (T2D) [OR 6 (95% CI 3-14); p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001)] and low HDL cholesterol (HDL-c) [OR 6 (95% CI 3-14); p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001)] were significant risk factors for COVID-19 infection independent of age, sex and obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Among Arab Gulf residents screened for SARS-CoV-2, serum 25(OH) D levels were observed to be lower in those who tested positive than negative individuals, but it was the presence of old age, diabetes mellitus and low-HDL-c that were significantly associated with risk of COVID-19 infection. Large population-based randomized controlled trials should be conducted to assess the protective effects of vitamin D supplementation against COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID- 19) constitutes a major global pandemic health care system challenge. Shortly following the disease outbreak, like SARS-CoV virus, all affected countries are implementing various preventive and control measures to mitigate the spread of the disease. Optimizing public health system during COVID-19 pandemic requires not only advanced medical and biological sciences knowledge, but also all human sciences related to social, as well as nutritional behavior, and lifestyle practices. AIM: To investigate the effect of COVID-19- quarantine on healthy nutritional behavior and lifestyle practices among Jordanian population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study among Jordanian population was conducted using an online questionnaire between March and April 2020. Participants were kindly requested to answer a standardized and validated structured questionnaire. Demographic information (age, gender, place of residence, and occupation), anthropometric data (reported weight and height); nutritional behavior information (number of meals per day, snakes, water intake), and physical activity behavior were requested. RESULTS: A total of 4473 respondents were included in the study; obese (n¬†=¬†1135), normal body weight (n¬†=¬†1561), and underweight (n¬†=¬†116). During COVID-19 quarantine, a significant increase in body weight (12.9% underweight, 28.5% normal body weight, 36.4% overweight' and 41.1% of obese (p¬†<¬†0.001) was reported. Moreover, the number of snacks between meals (p¬†<¬†0.001), number of main meals (p¬†<¬†0.001), and the smoking rate was also increased significantly; however, there was no significant difference regarding physical activity among various weight status groups (p¬†<¬†0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have provided evidence, for the first time, that there were significant negative changes in healthy nutritional behavior among Jordanians during COVID-19 quarantine who encountered significantly increased body weight, appetite, and smoking. Hence, future larger cross-sectional studies are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: People with chronic conditions such as cancer, kidney disease, lung disease, diabetes, dementia, obesity, and heart conditions are at elevated risk of developing severe complications, and are thus at greater risk of death due to COVID-19. The COVID-19 vaccine is an effective measure to manage the pandemic as it prevents severe illness and death. Nevertheless, many people are hesitant to receive the COVID-19 vaccine due to fear of its side effects. The aim of this study was to identify the risk and protective factors of accepting COVID-19 vaccination among Saudi Arabian people with chronic diseases. METHODS: This study extracted data from an online cross-sectional self-reported questionnaire conducted on the acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine in Saudi Arabia in December 2020. The study included a sample of 521 adults who self-reported that they had chronic diseases. Multivariable regression analyses were employed to identify the factors associated with accepting COVID-19 vaccination in Saudi Arabia. The estimates were adjusted for confounding variables, including socio-demographic factors. RESULTS: Among the sampled participants of Saudi adults with chronic diseases, approximately 52% indicated that they were willing to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. Participants had higher willingness to accept the vaccine if they received the seasonal influenza vaccination in the past [odds ratio (OR): 2.179; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.222-3.888], reported high or very high levels of concern about contracting COVID-19 (OR: 2.426; 95% CI: 1.209-4.867), or believed in mandatory COVID-19 vaccination (OR: 84.848; 95% CI: 37.651-191.207). Participants had lower willingness to be vaccinated if they had a history of vaccine refusal (OR: 0.211; 95% CI: 0.088-0.504). Among the socio-demographic factors, being male (OR: 2.153; 95% CI: 1.007-4.603), having a postgraduate degree (OR: 2.408; 95% CI: 0.985-5.886), and being unemployed (OR: 2.780; 95% CI: 0.876-8.827) were associated with an increased willingness of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study demonstrate that willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination among Saudi Arabian adults with chronic conditions is low. Therefore, further policy measures are required to manage COVID-19-related infections and the death toll.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To this end, the influence of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their neonates is not completely clear. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to investigate maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Besides, it investigates the likelihood of vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection from pregnant women to their neonates. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted in three medical centers during the period from March to November 2020. Data were collected from the available medical records in the respective hospitals using a standardized questionnaire on maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes. All pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection across the three hospitals and their neonates were eligible to participate in this study. Descriptive statistics were presented as a median and interquartile range (IQR) or frequencies and percentages as appropriate using SPSS 24.0 software. RESULTS: This study has identified a total of 288 pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection over the study period of a median age of 30 years and median GA at diagnosis 38 weeks (IQR: 39 -33) as well as 27% of them were obese (n=78). The majority of pregnant women were symptomatic with cough (n=92, 31.9%) being the most frequent COVID-19 symptom followed by fever and dyspnea (n=36, 12.5%). Two-hundred and four pregnant delivered (70.84%) and caesarean sections were prevalent among 35.8% of them. The most common adverse pregnancy outcome was premature (n=31, 15.5%), followed by fetal distress (n=13, 6.5%), preeclampsia (n=4, 2.0%), and one pregnant woman died. The laboratory results exhibit that temperature higher than 38 (n=27), leukopenia (n=19), neutropenia (n=54), ALT (n=12), AST (n=31), and thrombocytopenia (n=35) were less frequent among pregnant women while lymphopenia (n=126), hemoglobin levels lower than 13.0 (n=218), deceased albumin levels (n=195) were most frequent among them. However, a small proportion of pregnant women were admitted to the ICU (3.8%). The most frequent maternal treatments were antibiotics (n=81), antiviral (n=49), and corticosteroid (n=24). Of 204 neonates, four had died and all the remaining neonates were alive. The median gestational age at delivery was 39 weeks (IQR: 35-40). Most neonates had normal laboratory results. However, 14 had lymphopenia (7.0%), 22 had neutropenia (11.0%), and 11 had thrombocytopenia (5.5%). Four infants had low hemoglobin levels of less than 13.0 (2.0%) and 81 had hyperbilirubinemia (e.g., total bilirubin of higher than 23; 40.5%). Approximately less than one-half of neonates required admission to the NICU (n=86, 43%), 7% of them required respiratory support of mechanical ventilation, and none of them get infected with COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSION: This multicenter study suggests that the majority of pregnant women had mild or moderate disease symptoms. Nevertheless, this study did not find any evidence of possible vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection from mothers to their babies. This study may provide a baseline for further studies focusing on investigating long-term maternal and neonate's outcomes and possible vertical transmission of COVID-19 from mothers to their newborn babies.

AB  - Emotional eating (EE) is prevalent among women and is associated with obesity. The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and mandatory quarantine increased the risk of mental symptoms and, inferentially, emotional eating (EE). We investigated the EE prevalence and predictors during this pandemic. Overall, 638 women, ages 18-39, completed an online survey incorporating the Emotional Eating Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. We asked about nutrition and collected data on weight, height, and pandemic responses. Most respondents (47.2%) reported low EE; 40.4% were "moderate" and 12.4% "high" emotional eaters; 42.8% reported depression, 27% anxiety, 71% moderate stress, and 12.5% severe stress. The main EE indicators/predictors were fat intake (Œ≤ = 0.192, p = 0.004), number of meals (Œ≤ = 0.187, p < 0.001), sugar consumption (Œ≤ = 0.150, p < 0.001), body mass index (Œ≤ = 0.149, p < 0.001), stress (Œ≤ = 0.143, p = 0.004), energy intake (Œ≤ = 0.134, p = 0.04), and fast food intake frequency (Œ≤ = 0.111, p < 0.01). EE score correlated negatively with increased family income (Œ≤ = -0.081, p = 0.049). Higher stress correlated with worse sleep, less sleep, and less physical activity. Emotional eating is common among young Saudi women during the pandemic. We recommend healthy food choices and increased physical activity to improve sleep and mitigate stress.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health concern. It has affected more than 5 million patients worldwide and resulted in an alarming number of deaths globally. While clinical characteristics have been reported elsewhere, data from our region is scarce. We investigated the clinical characteristics of mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study. Data of 401 confirmed COVID-19 patients were collected from 22 April 2020 to 21 May 2020 at five tertiary care hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The patients were divided into four groups according to age, Group 1: 0-<18 years, Group 2: 18-<50 years, Group 3: 50-60 years, and Group 4: >60 years; and their clinical symptoms were compared. RESULTS: The median (IQR) age in years was 10.5 (1.5-16) in group I, 34 (29-41) in group II, 53 (51-56) in group III, and 66 (61-76) in group IV. Most patients were male (80%, n = 322) and of Arabian or Asian descent. The median length of stay in the hospital was 10 (8-17) days (range 3-42 days). The most common symptoms were cough (53.6%), fever (36.2%), fatigue (26.4%), dyspnea (21.9%), and sore throat (21.9%). Hypertension was the most common underlying comorbidity (14.7%), followed by obesity (11.5%), and diabetes (10%). Hypertensive patients were less likely to present with shortness of breath, cough, sputum, diarrhea, and fever. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in the symptoms among different age groups and comorbidities were mostly seen in the older age group. Interestingly, hypertensive patients were found to have milder symptoms and a shorter length of stay. Further larger collaborative national studies are required to effectively understand clinical characteristics in our part of the world to efficiently manage and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is straining the healthcare system, particularly for patients with severe outcomes requiring admittance to the intensive care unit (ICU). This study investigated the potential associations of obesity and diabetes with COVID-19 severe outcomes, assessed as ICU admittance. Medical history, demographic and patient characteristics of a retrospective cohort (1158 patients) hospitalized with COVID-19 were analysed at a single centre in Kuwait. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the associations between different variables and ICU admittance. Of 1158 hospitalized patients, 271 had diabetes, 236 had hypertension and 104 required admittance into the ICU. From patients with available measurements, 157 had body mass index (BMI) ‚â•25‚Äâkg/m(2) . Univariate analysis showed that overweight, obesity class I and morbid obesity were associated with ICU admittance. Patients with diabetes were more likely to be admitted to the ICU. Two models for multivariate regression analysis assessed either BMI or diabetes on ICU outcomes. In the BMI model, class I and morbid obesities were associated with ICU admittance. In the diabetes model, diabetes was associated with increased ICU admittance, whereas hypertension had a protective effect on ICU admittance. In our cohort, overweight, obesity and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 were associated with ICU admittance, increasing the risk of poor outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: A growing body of data suggests that obesity influences coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our study's primary objective was to assess the association between body mass index (BMI) categories and critical forms of COVID-19. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Data on consecutive adult patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at Amiens University Hospital (Amiens, France) were extracted retrospectively. The association between BMI categories and the composite primary endpoint (admission to the intensive care unit or death) was probed in a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In total, 433 patients were included, and BMI data were available for 329: 20 were underweight (6.1%), 95 have a normal weight (28.9%), 90 were overweight (27.4%), and 124 were obese (37.7%). The BMI category was associated with the primary endpoint in the fully adjusted model; the odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for overweight and obesity were respectively 1.58 [0.77-3.24] and 2.58 [1.28-5.31]. The ORs [95% CI] for ICU admission were similar for overweight (3.16 [1.29-8.06]) and obesity (3.05 [1.25-7.82]) in the fully adjusted model. The unadjusted ORs for death were similar in all BMI categories while obesity only was associated with higher risk after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that overweight (and not only obesity) is associated with ICU admission, but overweight is not associated with death.

AB  - AIMS: To determine the prevalence and factors associated with depression and anxiety among people with and without diabetes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study collecting demographic and mental health data from 2166 participants living in the Arab Gulf region (568 with diabetes, 1598 without diabetes). Depression and anxiety were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, respectively. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms were 61% and 45%, in people with diabetes (PWD) and 62% and 44%, respectively, in people without diabetes. PWD who have had their diabetes visit canceled by the clinic were more likely to report depression and anxiety symptoms than those without diabetes (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.37 [1.02, 1.84] and 1.37 [1.04, 1.80], for depression and anxiety; respectively). PWD who had no method of telecommunication with their health care providers (HCP) during the pandemic, PWD with A1C of ‚â• 10%, women, employees (particularly HCPs), students, unmarried individuals, and those with lower income were more likely to report depression and/or anxiety symptoms (all P‚Äâ< 0.01). Fear of acquiring the coronavirus infection; running out of diabetes medications; or requiring hospitalization for hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis; and lack of telecommunication with HCPs were all associated with significantly higher odds of having depression and anxiety symptoms among PWD. CONCLUSIONS: The remarkably high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among subgroups of PWD, calls for urgent public health policies to address mental health during the pandemic and reestablish health care access for PWD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of telemedicine in diabetes care became more evident during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as many people with diabetes, especially those in areas without well-established telemedicine, lost access to their health care providers (HCPs) during this pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We describe a simplified protocol of a Diabetes Telemedicine Clinic that utilizes technological tools readily available to most people with diabetes and clinics around the world. We report the satisfaction of 145 patients and 14 HCPs who participated in the virtual clinic and 210 patients who attended the virtual educational sessions about "Diabetes and Ramadan." RESULTS: The majority of patients agreed or strongly agreed that the use of telemedicine was essential in maintaining a good glucose control during the pandemic (97%) and they would use the clinic again in the future (86%). A similar high satisfaction was reported by patients who attended the "Diabetes and Ramadan" virtual educational session and 88% of them recommended continuing this activity as a virtual session every year. Majority of the HCPs (93%) thought the clinic protocol was simple and did not require a dedicated orientation session prior to implementing. CONCLUSIONS: The simplicity of our Diabetes Telemedicine Clinic protocol and the high satisfaction reported by patients and HCPs make it a suitable model to be adopted by clinics, especially during pandemics or disasters in resource-limited settings. This clinic model can be quickly implemented and does not require technological tools other than those widely available to most people with diabetes, nowadays. We were able to successfully reduce the number of patients, HCPs, and staff physically present in the clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic without negatively impacting the patients' nor the HCPs' satisfaction with the visits.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data regarding the differentiating characteristics of patients with laboratory-confirmed and those negative for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). METHODS: This is a hospital-based case-control study comparing MERS-CoV-positive patients (cases) with MERS-CoV-negative controls. RESULTS: A total of 17 case patients and 82 controls with a mean age of 60.7 years and 57 years, respectively (P = .553), were included. No statistical differences were observed in relation to sex, the presence of a fever or cough, and the presence of a single or multilobar infiltrate on chest radiography. The case patients were more likely to be overweight than the control group (mean body mass index, 32 vs 27.8; P = .035), to have diabetes mellitus (87% vs 47%; odds ratio [OR], 7.24; P = .015), and to have end-stage renal disease (33% vs 7%; OR, 7; P = .012). At the time of admission, tachypnea (27% vs 60%; OR, 0.24; P = .031) and respiratory distress (15% vs 51%; OR, 0.15; P = .012) were less frequent among case patients. MERS-CoV patients were more likely to have a normal white blood cell count than the control group (82% vs 52%; OR, 4.33; P = .029). Admission chest radiography with interstitial infiltrates was more frequent in case patients than in controls (67% vs 20%; OR, 8.13; P = .001). Case patients were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (53% vs 20%; OR, 4.65; P = .025) and to have a high mortality rate (76% vs 15%; OR, 18.96; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Few clinical predictors could enhance the ability to predict which patients with pneumonia would have MERS-CoV. However, further prospective analysis and matched case-control studies may shed light on other predictors of infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether the timing of hospital admission is associated with the risk of mortality for patients with COVID-19 in England, and the factors associated with a longer interval between symptom onset and hospital admission. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study of data collected by the COVID-19 Hospitalisation in England Surveillance System (CHESS). Data were analysed using multivariate regression analysis. SETTING: Acute hospital trusts in England that submit data to CHESS routinely. PARTICIPANTS: Of 14 150 patients included in CHESS until 13 May 2020, 401 lacked a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and 7666 lacked a recorded date of symptom onset. This left 6083 individuals, of whom 15 were excluded because the time between symptom onset and hospital admission exceeded 3 months. The study cohort therefore comprised 6068 unique individuals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause mortality during the study period. RESULTS: Timing of hospital admission was an independent predictor of mortality following adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities, ethnicity and obesity. Each additional day between symptom onset and hospital admission was associated with a 1% increase in mortality risk (HR 1.01; p<0.005). Healthcare workers were most likely to have an increased interval between symptom onset and hospital admission, as were people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, and patients with obesity. CONCLUSION: The timing of hospital admission is associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19. Healthcare workers and individuals from a BAME background are at greater risk of later admission, which may contribute to reports of poorer outcomes in these groups. Strategies to identify and admit patients with high-risk and those showing signs of deterioration in a timely way may reduce the consequent mortality from COVID-19, and should be explored.

AB  - The global pandemic of COVID-19 is posing the biggest threat to humanity through its ubiquitous effect of unfathomable magnitude. Although COVID-19 is a viral disease, there might be an association between different comorbidities and the occurrence of the disease. Our study aims to determine the association between the COVID-19 infection and pre-existing comorbidities such as asthma, diabetes, liver disease, lung disease, heart disease, kidney disease, hypertension, and obesity through a web-based self-reported survey. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were done using these risk factors as independent variables. A total of 780,961 participants from 183 different countries and territories participated in this study. Among them, 1516 participants were diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to this study. A significant risk association was observed for age above 60¬†years, female gender, as well as different pre-existing disease conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, and heart diseases. Asthma and diabetes were the major dominant comorbidities among patients, and patients with existing diabetes were more likely to develop the disease than others who did not diagnose as diseased. Therefore, older adults, females, as well as people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, kidney disease, and liver disease are the most vulnerable population for COVID-19. However, further studies should be carried out to explain the pathway of these risk associations.

AB  - The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has killed many people worldwide since December 2019, and Iran has been among the most affected countries. In this retrospective study, we aimed to determine the prognostic factors associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients by analyzing 396 survived and 63 non-survived patients in Shahid Modarres Hospital, Tehran, Iran, from January 30(th) until April 5(th), 2020. As the results, the BMI > 35 (p = 0.0003), lung cancer (p = 0.007), chronic kidney disease (p = 0.002), Immunocompromised condition (p = 0.003), and diabetes (p = 0.018) were more frequently observed in the expired group. The history of statins use was more common in the discharged group (p = 0.002), while there was no significant difference in the drug history of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, and/or steroids, and in the past-year influenza vaccination. Multivariable regression demonstrated rising odds of in-hospital death related with age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.055, p = 0.002), levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (OR = 2.915, p < 0.001), creatinine (OR = 1.740, p = 0.023), lymphocyte count (OR = 0.999, p = 0.008), and magnesium level (OR = 0.032, p < 0.001) on admission. In conclusion, the patients with older age and higher BMI with lymphopenia, hypomagnesemia, elevated CRP and/or raised creatinine on admission are at higher risk of mortality due to the COVID-19 infection, which requires the physicians to use timely and strong therapeutic measures for such patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Overburdened healthcare systems during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic led to suboptimal chronic disease management, including that of pediatric type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The pandemic also caused delayed detection of new-onset diabetes in children; this increased the risk and severity of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). We therefore investigated the frequency of new-onset pediatric T1DM and DKA in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared it to the same period in 2019. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study, including patients aged 1-14 years admitted with new-onset T1DM or DKA during the COVID-19 pandemic (March-June 2020) and the same period in 2019. We assessed factors including age, sex, anthropometric measures, nationality, duration of diabetes, diabetes management, HbA1c levels, glycemic control, cause of admission, blood gas levels, etiology of DKA, DKA complications, length of hospital stay, and COVID-19 test status. RESULT: During the lockdown, 106 children, compared with 154 in 2019, were admitted to 6 pediatric diabetes centers. Among the admissions, DKA was higher in 2020 than in 2019 (83% vs. 73%; P=0.05; risk ratio=1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.26), after adjusting for age and sex. DKA frequency among new-onset T1DM and HbA1c levels at diagnosis were higher in 2020 than in 2019 (26% vs. 13.4% [P=<0.001] and 12.1 ¬± 0.2 vs. 10.8 ¬± 0.25 [P<0.001], respectively). Females and older patients had a higher risk of DKA. CONCLUSION: The lockdown implemented in Saudi Arabia has significantly impacted children with T1DM and led to an increased DKA frequency, including children with new-onset T1DM, potentially owing to delayed presentation.

AB  - Epidemiological evidence establishes obesity as an independent risk factor for increased susceptibility and severity to viral respiratory pneumonias associated with H1N1 influenza and SARS-CoV-2 pandemics. Given the global obesity prevalence, a better understanding of the mechanisms behind obese susceptibility to infection is imperative. Altered immune cell metabolism and function are often perceived as a key causative factor of dysregulated inflammation. However, the contribution of adipocytes, the dominantly altered cell type in obesity with broad inflammatory properties, to infectious disease pathogenesis remains largely ignored. Thus, skewing of adipocyte-intrinsic cellular metabolism may lead to the development of pathogenic inflammatory adipocytes, which shape the overall immune responses by contributing to either premature immunosenescence, delayed hyperinflammation, or cytokine storm in infections. In this review, we discuss the underappreciated contribution of adipocyte cellular metabolism and adipocyte-produced mediators on immune system modulation and how such interplay may modify disease susceptibility and pathogenesis of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections in obese individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is variable and ranges from asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic, moderately severe and severe disease. A small proportion might develop severe disease and may have cytokine storm. One of the therapeutic options to treat such cases is Tocilizumab (TCZ). In this study, we present cases of severe COVID-19 treated with TCZ and glucocorticoids and discuss the treatment responses. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of severe COVID-19 cases treated with TCZ and glucocorticoids. The case series examined the characteristics and outcome of those patients. RESULTS: This study included 40 Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) confirmed patients who received TCZ and glucocorticoids. The mean age of the included patients was 57.55 (¬±Standard deviation 12.86) years. There were 34 (85%) males, 19 (47.5%) were obese (BMI >30), 13 (32.5%) over weight, and five (12.5%) normal weight. The mean days from positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to admission was 1.641 (¬±3.2) days. Of the patients, 18 (45%) had diabetes mellitus, 14 (35%) had hypertension. The mean days from hospital admission to ICU was 1.8 (¬±2.6), 20 (50%) required mechanical ventilation, 39 (97.5%) had received prone position, seven (17.5%) had renal replacement therapy, 13 (32.5%) required inotropes, four (10%) had plasmapheresis, one (2.5%) had intravenous immunoglobulin, all patients received steroid therapy, and the majority 31 (77.5%) did not receive any anti-viral therapy. Of all the patients, six (15%) died, 28 (70%) were discharged and six (15%) were still in hospital. CONCLUSION: The overall mortality rate was lower than those cited in meta-analysis. As our understanding of the COVID-19 continues, the approach and therapeutics are also evolving.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many countries have implemented various levels of lockdown to mitigate the spread of the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In the United Kingdom, the national lockdown restrictions were implemented between 26 March 2020 and 4 July 2020. These restrictions required all restaurants to close except for takeaway and delivery services. Moreover, individuals were instructed to largely stay in their homes, unless they were identified as essential workers, and to only leave home once per day for exercise. These restrictions might have an impact on energy intake and expenditure, thereby affecting their body weight. AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the movement restrictions in the United Kingdom on food outlet usage and body mass index (BMI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Food outlet usage surveys were filled out for 7 consecutive days before and during the lockdown. Changes in BMI and food outlet usage before and during the lockdown were measured. A total of 206 participants were included in this study. RESULTS: The mean overall BMI prior to lockdown was 25.8¬†¬±¬†5.2 kg¬∑m(2), and during the lockdown, it was 25.9¬†¬±¬†5.3 kg¬∑m(2) (t=¬†0.19, p=¬†0.85). Restaurant usage fell to zero as all establishments were closed. There was a corresponding increase in the use of delivery services to 1.18¬†¬±¬†0.13 times per week, compared to 0.50¬†¬±¬†0.05 prior to lockdown (t=¬†4.44, p<¬†0.0001). No significant difference in the number of takeaway meals ordered was observed (0.67¬†¬±¬†0.06 before the lockdown and 0.74¬†¬±¬†0.12 times per week during the lockdown; t=¬†0.52, p¬†=¬†0.60). There was no significant relationship between change in use of fast-food restaurants and full-service restaurants and the change in BMI, either alone or in combination (Œ≤¬†=¬†-0.012, p¬†=¬†0.62, R (2)¬†=¬†0.11%). DISCUSSION: Despite the large changes in behavior, there was no overall adverse effect of the lockdown with respect to obesity levels. CONCLUSION: Lockdown in the United Kingdom modified restaurant use but had no effect on obesity levels.

AB  - Obese patients are at increased risk of exacerbations from viral respiratory infections. During the H1N1 pandemic, obesity was associated with an increased risk of influenza-associated intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and longer duration of ICU and hospital length of stay compared with the non-obese. These observations have raised a concern about the correlation between obesity and the current COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we have outlined the potential impacts of obesity on respiratory physiology and the function of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Also, it has been clearly illustrated that obese patients are potentially more vulnerable to COVID-19 and more contagious than lean patients. The comorbidities associated with obesity were found to be correlated with a severe clinical course of COVID-19 and increased mortality and high BMI has been shown to be correlated with hospitalisation, the need for mechanical ventilation and non-survival. The review also sheds light on the challenges that obese patients pose for healthcare providers inside and outside ICUs.

AB  - The severe respiratory and systemic disease named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a huge social and health challenge worldwide. Many different risk factors are associated with disease severity, such as systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, older age, and other co-infections. Other respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and smoking are common comorbidities worldwide. Previous investigations have identified among COVID-19 patients smokers and COPD patients, but recent investigations have questioned the higher risk among these populations. Nevertheless, previous reports failed to isolate smokers and COPD patients without other comorbidities. We performed a longitudinal evaluation of the disease course of smokers, former smokers, and COPD patients with COVID-19 without other comorbidities, from hospitalization to hospital discharge. Although no difference between groups was observed during hospital admission, smokers and COPD patients presented an increase in COVID-19-associated inflammatory markers during the disease course in comparison to non-smokers and former smokers. Our results demonstrated that smoking and COPD are risk factors for severe COVID-19 with possible implications for the ongoing pandemic.

AB  - The current coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents a huge challenge for health-care systems worldwide. Many different risk factors are associated with disease severity, such as older age, diabetes, hypertension, and most recently obesity. The incidence of obesity has been on the rise for the past 25‚Äâyears, reaching over 2 billion people throughout the world, and obesity itself could be considered a pandemic. In this review, we summarize aspects involved with obesity, such as changes in the immune response, nutritional factors, physiological factors, and the gut-lung axis, that impact the viral response and the COVID-19 prognosis.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Severe COVID-19 cases develop severe acute respiratory syndrome, which can result in multiple organ failure, sepsis, and death. The higher risk group includes the elderly and subjects with pre-existing chronic illnesses such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. To date, no specific treatment or vaccine is available for COVID-19. Among many compounds, naringenin (NAR) a flavonoid present in citrus fruits has been investigated for antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties like reducing viral replication and cytokine production. In this perspective, we summarize NAR potential anti-inflammatory role in COVID-19 associated risk factors and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - PURPOSE: On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a "public health emergency of international concern." The primary aim of the study was to evaluate weight and food habit changes during COVID-19 outbreak. The secondary endpoint was to explore the psychological factors, arising during the pandemic, influencing weight and dietary variations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey composed of four different items was conducted by telephone interview: (1) anthropometric data and type of procedure, (2) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), (3) maladaptive eating behaviors, and (4) personal feelings moved by the COVID-19 spread and lockdown. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were enrolled. No significant changes in weight, BMI, and maladaptive eating habits were observed. A significant reduction in the anxiety index score was observed. In 17.8% of cases, a change in obesity class was reported, and among these patients, a substantial modification in bariatric procedures was planned (60%). CONCLUSION: This study showed no effect on weight and BMI nor on rates of maladaptive eating habits associated with quarantine/social isolation among severely obese individuals waiting for the bariatric surgery. At the end of lockdown, a considerable proportion of patients modified their initial obesity class, and in selected cases, it could represent a criteria for rearrangement of the planned bariatric procedure. In obese patients, the lockdown and social distancing generated a reduction of fear of confronting and being negatively judged by others. This psychological aspect was assessed with the reduction of the HADS score.

AB  - At the end of 2019, a new disease with pandemic potential appeared in China. It was a novel coronavirus called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Later, in the first quarter of 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of this disease a pandemic. Elderly people, people with comorbidities, and health care professionals are more vulnerable to COVID-19. Obesity has been growing exponentially worldwide, affecting several age groups. It is a morbidity that is associated with genetic, epigenetic, environment factors and/or interaction between them. Obesity is associated with the development of several diseases including diabetes mellitus, mainly type 2. Diabetes affects a significant portion of the global population. Obesity and diabetes are among the main risk factors for the development of severe symptoms of COVID-19, and individuals with these conditions constitute a risk group. Based on a literature review on obesity in people with diabetes in the framework of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study presents updated important considerations and care to be taken with this population.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a deadly global pandemic, with scientific efforts improving our understanding of this novel coronavirus. No proven disease-specific therapies exist, although 2 vaccines have been recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration under emergency use authorization, and several others are in development or phase III clinical trial testing. COVID-19 presents in greater severity in the medically fragile, obese, elderly, and socially disadvantaged, and children in general are less affected. All children are at risk, but those with comorbidities and neonates are more susceptible. The multisystem inflammatory syndrome is a severe version which can present in any child with a recent COVID-19 infection. The face of the pandemic has been changing in the last few months, with recent increasing cases, virus mutations, and onset of vaccination. This article provides COVID-19 management for children and adolescents and implications for nursing and advanced practice providers.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had major negative health, psychological, social and economic repercussions for individuals, families, communities, countries and for humanity in general. The interrelation with age and the presence of chronic non-communicable diseases (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking) seems to go further than what would be explained by the prevalence and distribution of both. The drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are in many cases the backbone for the management of these diseases, it has been known for a long time that these drugs significantly increase the expression of receptors for angiotensin conversion enzyme type 2 in the lung tissue. This fact, together with the knowledge that the route of entry of the virus into the cell is precisely the ACE-2 receptor, initiated a hypothesis, based on very low-quality evidence, which quickly became generalized in the media, that the use of these drugs could be negative and that they should be interrupted immediately. The response of practically all Scientific Societies was almost immediate, with the precise indication that treatment with these drugs should not be discontinued, since the evidence of their usefulness is based on very solid and high-quality evidence. Simultaneously, a different hypothesis also appeared, also based on very preliminary evidence, that these drugs are not only harmful but also beneficial, however these medicaments are not yet accepted as agents for the prevention or treatment of this disease or its complications. This review reports current knowledge on the relationship between COVID-19 and SRAA.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The impact of demographics and comorbidities on the duration of COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab PCR positivity remains unclear. The objective of our analysis is to determine the impact of age, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, comorbidities, and ethnicity on the duration of COVID-19 PCR positivity among hospitalized patients in a large group of hospital. METHOD: We studied 530 patients from a large hospital system and time to SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA PCR negativity at any-time during hospitalization or following discharge from the hospital was the primary endpoint. We included patients 18 years or older who tested positive for COVID-19 during an inpatient, outpatient, or emergency room visit between February 1, 2020, and April 14, 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 315 (59.4%) of our patient population continued to have a positive SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA PCR 4 weeks after the initial positive test. We found that age>70 years, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, or coronary artery disease are associated with persistent PCR positivity for more than 4 weeks after initial diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Age, and the presence of co-morbidities should be taken into consideration when interpreting a positive COVID PCR test.

AB  - Currently, the issue of lifestyle combined with lack of physical activity in quarantine conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic has become a major health problem in many countries around the world. Increased inactivity is associated with increased obesity as well as decreased physical activity and general health. Kidney stones are the third most common urinary tract disease. Prevention of non-communicable diseases depends on controlling risk factors such as low levels of physical activity. Kidney stones are also among the noncommunicable diseases that can be prevented by changing behavioral habits. Physical activity is a behavior that has many proven health benefits and is one of the most effective ways to prevent chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate sedentary lifestyle and its relationship with oxidative stress and kidney stone formation, and finally to provide medical solutions and recommendations.

AB  - Since being declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization WHO), Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a devastating effect on the global health and economy. The virus primarily affects the respiratory system and is spread from person to person via respiratory particles from coughing and sneezing. The majority of transmission occurs from close contact with presymptomatic, asymptomatic, or symptomatic carriers. The early course of the pandemic was characterized by the rapid spread of the virus that created an urgency to mitigate this new viral illness with experimental therapies and drug repurposing. Since then, due to an intense global research effort, significant progress has been made that has resulted in the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines at an unprecedented speed, leading to favorable patient outcomes. Currently, a variety of therapeutic options that include antiviral medications, monoclonal antibodies, and immunomodulatory agents are available in the management of COVID-19.¬†However, the therapeutic potential and clinical use of these drugs are limited and specifically based on the stage of the illness.¬† The pathogenesis of COVID-19 illness occurs in two distinct phases, an early stage characterized by profound SARS-CoV-2 viral replication followed by a late phase characterized by a hyperinflammatory state induced by the release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-Œ±(TNF Œ±), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Interleukin-(IL-1), IL-6, interferon (IFN)-Œ≥ and activation of the coagulation system resulting in a prothrombotic state. Antiviral therapy and antibody-based treatments are likely to be more effective if used during the early phase of the illness, and immunomodulating therapies either alone or in combination with antiviral and antibody-based therapies may be more effective when used in the later stage to combat the cytokine-mediated hyperinflammatory state that causes severe illness. Individuals of all ages are at risk for infection and severe disease. However, individuals aged ‚â•60 years and with underlying medical comorbidities (obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, smoking, cancer, solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients) are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. The percentage of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization was six times higher in those with preexisting medical conditions than those without medical conditions (45.4% vs. 7.6%) based on an analysis by Stokes et al. of confirmed cases reported to the CDC during January 22‚ÄìMay 30, 2020. A promising approach to address the COVID-19 associated mortality and prevent the increased utilization of healthcare resources is by terminating the progression of viral replication, thereby preventing the progression to the hyperinflammatory stage of COVID-19, which causes severe illness in high-risk nonhospitalized patients. Initially, the focus of treatment was directed mainly towards hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness. However, the clinical focus over the course of the pandemic has expanded toward combatting the illness early on by reducing the viral load in patients with early disease, thus attempting to halt the disease progression. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 have yielded positive in vitro results.¬†They are¬†considered a promising approach in managing nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of developing severe illness. This review discusses the mechanism of action of monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and current clinical indications of monoclonal antibody therapy for nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness who are at high risk of developing severe illness. Monoclonal Antibodies in COVID-19 Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are immune system proteins developed from a single cell lineage that demonstrate a high affinity for their target cell. Monoclonal antibodies were first developed by K√∂hler and Milstein in 1975 using hybridoma technology.¬†Since then, significant progress has been made in the molecular engineering world that has enabled the establishment of monoclonal antibodies as targeted therapies in various neoplastic conditions, autoimmune, post-transplant immunosuppression, and infectious diseases. When used as antiviral therapies, neutralizing antibodies play an indispensable part in achieving passive antiviral immunity and are also instrumental in the prevention or regulation of many viral illnesses. Over the years, passive immunization against many viral diseases was achieved by administering polyclonal sera obtained from convalescent human donors or animals. However, polyclonal antibody preparations are increasingly being replaced by monoclonal antibodies by virtue of them, demonstrating a favorable safety profile and target specificity when used in different viral diseases.¬†Palivizumab was the first antiviral monoclonal antibody approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prophylaxis of RSV in high-risk infants.¬†Over the years, significant developments in antibody engineering, improved understanding of the biology of viruses, and the direct and indirect effect of monoclonal antibodies on viral infections has resulted in the development of many novel monoclonal antibodies.¬†Like other antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, when used as antiviral agents, are also susceptible to developing resistance as a result of alterations in the viral genome which can alter the pathogenic potential of the virus resulting in the emergence of viral escape mutants, which may render the virus-resistant to a specific monoclonal antibody. To counter this viral escape phenomenon, a combination of monoclonal antibodies, commonly referred to as antibody cocktails, have been proposed with the rationale that combining two specific monoclonal antibodies that complement each other can preventing neutralization escape by targeting multiple viral epitopes.¬†There are an estimated 70 monoclonal antibodies currently in development or clinical trials to treat COVID-19. The FDA has granted four EUA for clinical use as combination antibody cocktails.

AB  - Public health endorsements during the present COVID-19 pandemic has led the governments of largely affected countries to imply policies that restrict social mobility to slow COVID-19 spread. The study aimed to explore the effects of COVID-19 home quarantine on lifestyle and health behavior of Saudi residents. An online survey in Saudi Arabia was launched from May 11 to June 6, 2020. The survey was designed by multidisciplinary scientists and academics uploaded and shared through the Google platform in Arabic and English languages. Questions presented related to responses "before" and "during" COVID-19 home quarantine. A total of 1965 respondents participated and were included in the analysis [921 (47.0%) males and 1044 (53.0%) females]. Non-Saudis were more likely to increase their physical activity during quarantine [odds ratio (95% confidence interval 1.41 (1.11-1.79); p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.005]. Prevalence of participants walking daily for more than 4 times per week significantly decreased during pandemic (before vs during, 30.5% vs 29.1%) which was in parallel to the significant increase in the prevalence of participants who did not perform daily walking during the quarantine (21% vs 22.9%; p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). The prevalence of participants who often consume snacks between meals increased during quarantine (27.4% vs 29.4%, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001), while the prevalence of participants who never consumed fresh fruits and vegetables significantly increased during home quarantine (2.4% vs 3.7%; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.019). The lockdown imposed in Saudi Arabia modestly but significantly impacted physical activity and dietary behaviors of several citizens and residents in an unhealthy way. Interventions to alleviate these acute adverse lifestyle behaviors during pandemic should be formulated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Organ transplant recipients are vulnerable to multiple infectious agents and in a world with a circulating SARS-CoV-2 virus, it would be expected that patients who are immunosuppressed would have higher mortality. OBJECTIVE: To determine the COVID-19 mortality in transplant recipients. METHODS: We conducted a search in PubMed and Google scholar databases using the keywords for COVID-19 and transplantation. All related studies between January 1, 2020 and May 7, 2020 were reviewed. All relevant published articles related to COVID-19 in transplant recipients were included. RESULTS: 46 articles were included; they studied a total of 320 transplant patients-220 kidney transplant recipients, 42 liver, 19 heart, 22 lung, 8 HSCT, and 9 dual organ transplant recipients. The overall mortality rate was 20% and was variable among different organs and different countries. 65 transplant recipients died of complications attributable to COVID-19; 33 were males (15% of males in this cohort), 8 females (8% of females in this cohort), and 24 whose sex was not determined. They had a median age of 66 (range: 32-87) years. The median transplantation duration was 8 years (range: 30 days to 20 years). The most frequent comorbidity reported was hypertensions followed by diabetes mellitus, obesity, malignancy, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The most frequent cause of death reported was acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSION: Transplant recipients in our cohort had a high mortality rate. However, outcomes were not the same in different countries based on outbreak settings. Mortality was noted in elder patients with comorbidities.

AB  - AIM: To minimize the spread of COVID-19, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) enforced a nationwide lockdown. We aimed to explore whether the manner in which Saudi patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) manage their disease has changed during this unparalleled lockdown. METHODS: An online survey exploring the effect of lockdown on T1D outcomes was distributed among T1D patients residing in KSA during lockdown. RESULTS: A total of 1010 patients responded to the survey. Around 40% reported communicating with their physicians during lockdown. Age, level of education, residence, previous visits to diabetes education clinics, last HbA1c value, and average monthly income were all significantly associated with communication with the treating physician (p = 0.008, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.002, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). Age, level of education, and average monthly income were significantly associated with experiencing severe hypoglycemia (p = 0.036, p = 0.03, and p < 0.001, respectively), while average monthly income and level of education were significantly associated with experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) (p < 0.001 and p = 0.0039, respectively); during lockdown. Patients who communicated with their physicians reported lower rates of severe hypoglycemia compared to those who did not (25.2% vs 30.7%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Age and level of education were significantly associated with communication with the treating physician, and experiencing severe hypoglycemia and DKA; in patients with T1D during the lockdown period in Saudi Arabia. Keeping two-way virtual communication channels between physicians and their T1D patients should be encouraged.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized Covid-19 patients with or without diabetes mellitus (DM) is limited in the Arab region. This study aims to fill this gap. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective study, medical records of hospitalized adults with confirmed Covid-19 [RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV2] at King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC)-King Khaled University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from May to July 2020 were analyzed. Clinical, radiological and serological information, as well as outcomes were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 439 patients were included (median age 55¬†years; 68.3% men). The most prevalent comorbidities were vitamin D deficiency (74.7%), DM (68.3%), hypertension (42.6%) and obesity (42.2%). During hospitalization, 77 out of the 439 patients (17.5%) died. DM patients have a significantly higher death rate (20.5% versus 12.3%; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.04) and lower survival time (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.016) than non-DM. Multivariate cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that age [Hazards ratio, HR 3.0 (95% confidence interval, CI 1.7-5.3); p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001], congestive heart failure [adjusted HR 3.5 (CI 1.4-8.3); p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.006], smoking [adjusted HR 5.8 (CI 2.0-17.2); p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001], Œ≤-blocker use [adjusted HR 1.7 (CI 1.0-2.9); p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.04], bilateral lung infiltrates [adjusted HR 1.9 (CI 1.1-3.3); p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.02], creatinine‚Äâ>‚Äâ90¬†¬µmol/l [adjusted HR 2.1 (CI 1.3-3.5); p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.004] and 25(OH)D‚Äâ<‚Äâ12.5¬†nmol/l [adjusted HR 7.0 (CI 1.7-28.2); p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.007] were significant predictors of mortality among hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Random blood glucose‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ11.1¬†mmol/l was significantly associated with intensive care admission [adjusted HR 1.5 (CI 1.0-2.2); p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.04], as well as smoking, Œ≤-blocker use, neutrophil‚Äâ>‚Äâ7.5, creatinine‚Äâ>‚Äâ90¬†¬µmol/l and alanine aminotransferase‚Äâ>‚Äâ65U/l. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of DM is high among hospitalized Covid-19 patients in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. While DM patients have a higher mortality rate than their non-DM counterparts, other factors such as old age, congestive heart failure, smoking, Œ≤-blocker use, presence of bilateral lung infiltrates, elevated creatinine and severe vitamin D deficiency, appear to be more significant predictors of fatal outcome. Patients with acute metabolic dysfunctions, including hyperglycemia on admission are more likely to receive intensive care.

AB  - PURPOSE: As the world continues to cautiously navigate its way through the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, several breakthroughs in therapies and vaccines are currently being developed and scrutinized. Consequently, alternative therapies for severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) prevention, such as vitamin D supplementation, while hypothetically promising, require substantial evidence from countries affected by COVID-19. The present retrospective case-control study aims to identify differences in vitamin D status and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients screened for SARS-CoV-2, and determine associations of vitamin D levels with increased COVID-19 risk and mortality. METHODS: A total of 222 [SARS-CoV-2 (+) N‚Äâ=‚Äâ150 (97 males; 53 females); SARS-CoV-2 (-) N‚Äâ=‚Äâ72 (38 males, 34 females)] out of 550 hospitalized adult patients screened for SARS-CoV-2 and admitted at King Saud University¬†Medical City-King Khalid University Hospital (KSUMC-KKUH) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from May-July 2020 were included. Clinical, radiologic and serologic data, including 25(OH)D levels were analyzed. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D‚Äâ<‚Äâ50¬†nmol/l) was present in 75% of all patients. Serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower among SARS-CoV-2 (+) than SARS-CoV-2 (-) patients after adjusting for age, sex and body mass index (BMI) (35.8‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1.5¬†nmol/l vs. 42.5‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3.0¬†nmol/l; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.037). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that significant predictors for SARS-CoV-2 include age‚Äâ>‚Äâ60¬†years and pre-existing conditions (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). Statistically significant predictors for mortality adjusted for covariates include male sex [Odds ratio, OR 3.3 (95% confidence interval, CI 1.2-9.2); p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.02], chronic kidney disease [OR 3.5 (95% CI 1.4-8.7); p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.008] and severe 25(OH)D deficiency (<‚Äâ12.5¬†nmol/l), but at borderline significance [OR 4.9 (95% CI (0.9-25.8); p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.06]. CONCLUSION: In hospital settings, 25(OH)D deficiency is not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but may increase risk for mortality in severely deficient cases. Clinical trials are warranted to determine whether vitamin D status correction provides protective effects against worse COVID-19 outcomes.

AB  - As highlighted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination is critical for infectious disease prevention and control. Obesity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality from respiratory virus infections. While obese individuals respond to influenza vaccination, what is considered a seroprotective response may not fully protect the global obese population. In a cohort vaccinated with the 2010-2011 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, baseline immune history and vaccination responses were found to significantly differ in obese individuals compared to healthy controls, especially towards the 2009 pandemic strain of A/H1N1 influenza virus. Young, obese individuals displayed responses skewed towards linear peptides versus conformational antigens, suggesting aberrant obese immune response. Overall, these data have vital implications for the next generation of influenza vaccines, and towards the current SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign. ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY: Obese individuals have altered baseline and post-vaccination influenza antibody repertoires.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To minimize the spread of Coronavirus Disease-2019, Saudi Arabia imposed a nationwide lockdown for over 6¬†weeks. We examined the impact of lockdown on glycemic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM); and assessed whether changes in glycemic control differ between those who attended a telemedicine visit during lockdown versus those who did not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Flash CGM data from 101 individuals with T1D were retrospectively evaluated. Participants were categorized into two groups: Attended a telemedicine visit during lockdown (n¬†=¬†61) or did not attend (n¬†=¬†40). Changes in CGM metrics from the last 2¬†weeks pre-lockdown period (Feb 25 - March 9, 2020) to the last 2¬†weeks of complete lockdown period (April 7-20, 2020) were examined in the two groups. RESULTS: Those who attended a telemedicine visit during the lockdown period had a significant improvement in the following CGM metrics by the end of lockdown: Average glucose (from 180 to 159¬†mg/dl, p¬†<¬†0.01), glycemic management indicator (from 7.7 to 7.2%, p¬†=¬†0.03), time in range (from 46 to 55%, p¬†<¬†0.01), and time above range (from 48 to 35%, p¬†<¬†0.01) without significant changes in time below range, number of daily scans or hypoglycemic events, and other indices. In contrast, there were no significant changes in any of the CGM metrics during lockdown in those who did not attend telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: A six-week lockdown did not worsen, nor improve, glycemic control in individuals with T1D who did not attend a telemedicine visit. Whereas those who attended a telemedicine visit had a significant improvement in glycemic metrics; supporting the clinical effectiveness of telemedicine in diabetes care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic and has placed significant demand for acute and critical care services on hospitals in many countries. OBJECTIVES: To determine the predictors of severe COVID-19 disease requiring admission to an ICU by comparing patients who were ICU admitted to non-ICU groups. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted for the laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to six Saudi Ministry of Health's hospitals in Alahsa, between March 1, 2020, and July 30, 2020, by reviewing patient's medical records retrospectively. RESULTS: This cohort included 1014 patients with an overall mean age of 47.2‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ19.3¬†years and 582 (57%) were males. A total of 205 (20%) of the hospitalized patients were admitted to the ICU. Hypertension, diabetes and obesity were the most common comorbidities in all study patients (27.2, 19.9, and 9%, respectively). The most prevalent symptoms were cough (47.7%), shortness of breath (35.7%) and fever (34.3%). Compared with non-ICU group, ICU patients had older age (p‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ0.0005) and comprised a higher proportion of the current smokers and had higher respiratory rates (p‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ0.0005), and more percentage of body temperatures in the range of 37.3-38.0¬†¬∞C (p‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ0.0005); and had more comorbidities including diabetes (p‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ0.0005), hypertension (p‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ0.0005), obesity (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.048), and sickle cell disease (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.039). There were significant differences between the non-ICU and ICU groups for fever, shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, vomiting, dizziness; elevated white blood cells, neutrophils, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin, and decreased hemoglobin; and proportion of abnormal bilateral chest CT images (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). Significant differences were also found for multiple treatments (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). ICU patients group had a much higher mortality rate than those with non-ICU admission (p‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ0.0005). CONCLUSION: Identifying key clinical characteristics of COVID-19 that predict ICU admission and high mortality can be useful for frontline healthcare providers in making the right clinical decision under time-sensitive and resource-constricted environment.

AB  - Active lifestyle has enormous health benefits. However, physical activity has globally decreased since the beginning of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak because of social distancing measures. Older adults and people with age-related diseases (e.g., diabetes, obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disorders, etc.) are widely affected by COVID-19 and its grave adverse effects because of their baseline poor immune function. Although they are in intense need for the therapeutic benefits of exercise, they may express a low capacity for exercising due to skeletal muscle dysfunction and low motivation. Honey is a natural energy-rich, low glycemic index food with a variety of biological activities. It is reported to correct muscle pathology in diseased conditions. Because skeletal muscle is the key structure involved in exercise, we explored the literature for the exercise-promoting potential of natural honey. Bee honey improves physical performance at moderate levels of activity, and it reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers of fatigue following strenuous exercise among athletes. Supplementing ischemic heart disease patients with honey combined with floral pollen improved patients' tolerance for physical loads and corrected metabolism. Therefore, the therapeutic use of honey may have implications for to increasing the capacity for exercise in aged and diseased individuals. Soundly designed studies are needed to evaluate such possibility.

AB  - Ever since the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late 2019, it has killed millions of people worldwide. Even people not stricken by this disease are not spared from its negative economic, social, and health-related drawbacks. This commentary provides insight into the potential mechanisms involved in the development of depression and emotional negativity escalating during the current pandemic. In particular, preventive measures of COVID-19, such as staying at home, are sedentarism measures that decrease physical activity. Physical inactivity alters gut microbiome structure in a fashion that promotes gut dysbiosis and flaring of systemic inflammation, leading to the buildup of body fat. Obesity, which contributes to a trail of health-depleting disorders, furthers gut microbial disintegration while fat tissue stimulates the release of cytokines, promotes metabolic resistance, and alters signaling involved in the production of antioxidants. As a result, the body gets flooded by toxic molecules such pro-inflammatory mediators, free radicals, and advanced glycation end products. These toxic molecules alter cellular function in all body tissues, including those of the brain. Neuroinflammation is associated with progressive declines in cognitive and motor functions along with dysregulation in emotions. Counteracting the sedentarism enforced by the COVID-19 pandemic through the participation in suitable indoors activities and the intake of healthy food is likely to protect against or revert physiological impairments that may affect people retreating to their homes during the current crisis, eventually restoring physical and mental health.

AB  - Malnutrition is common among severe patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), mainly elderly adults and patients with comorbidities. It is also associated with atypical presentation of the disease. Despite the possible contribution of malnutrition to the acquisition and severity of COVID-19, it is not clear which nutritional screening measures may best diagnose malnutrition in these patients at early stages. This is of crucial importance given the urgency and rapid progression of the disease in vulnerable groups. Accordingly, this review examines the available literature for different nutritional screening approaches implemented among COVID-19 patients, with a special focus on elderly adults. After a literature search, we selected and scrutinized 14 studies assessing malnutrition among COVID-19 patients. The Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) has demonstrated superior sensitivity to other traditional screening measures. The controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, which comprises serum albumin level, cholesterol level, and lymphocytes count, as well as a combined CONUT-lactate dehydrogenase-C-reactive protein score expressed a predictive capacity even superior to that of NRS-2002 (0.81% and 0.92% vs. 0.79%) in midlife and elder COVID-19 patients. Therefore, simple measures based on routinely conducted laboratory investigations such as the CONUT score may be timely, cheap, and valuable alternatives for identifying COVID-19 patients with high nutritional risk. Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) was the only measure used to detect residual malnutrition and high malnutrition risk in remitting patients-MNA scores correlated with hypoalbuminemia, hypercytokinemia, and weight loss. Older males with severe inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, and pre-existing comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, or hypertension) are more prone to malnutrition and subsequently poor COVID-19 prognosis both during the acute phase and during convalescence. Thus, they are in need of frequent nutritional monitoring and support while detecting and treating malnutrition in the general public might be necessary to increase resilience against COVID-19.

AB  - Although the numbers of aged populations have risen considerably in the last few decades, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has revealed an extensive vulnerability among these populations. Sarcopenia is an age-related disorder that increases hospitalization, dependencies, and mortality in older adults. It starts to develop in midlife or even earlier as a result of unbalanced diet/poor nutrition and low levels of physical activity, in addition to chronic disorders such as obesity and diabetes mellitus. Given that social isolation is adopted as the most protective measure against COVID-19, the level of physical activity and the intake of adequate diet have considerably declined, especially among older adults-denoting an increased possibility for developing sarcopenia. Research also shows a higher vulnerability of sarcopenic people to COVID-19 as well as the development of wasting disorders such as sarcopenia and cachexia in a considerable proportion of symptomatic and recovering COVID-19 patients. Muscular wasting in COVID-19 is associated with poor prognosis. Accordingly, early detection and proper management of sarcopenia and wasting conditions in older adults and COVID-19 patients may minimize morbidity and mortality during the current COVID-19 crisis. This review explored different aspects of screening for sarcopenia, stressing their relevance to the detection of altered muscular structure and performance in patients with COVID-19. Current guidelines recommend prior evaluation of muscle strength by simple measures such as grip strength to identify individuals with proven weakness who then would be screened for muscle mass loss. The latter is best measured by MRI and CT. However, due to the high cost and radiation risk entailed by these techniques, other simpler and cheaper techniques such as DXA and ultrasound are given preference. Muscle loss in COVID-19 patients was measured during the acute phase by CT scanning of the pectoralis muscle simultaneously during a routine check for lung fibrosis, which seems to be an efficient evaluation of sarcopenia among those patients with no additional cost. In recovering patients, muscle strength and physical performance have been evaluated by electromyography and traditional tests such as the six-minute walk test. Effective preventive and therapeutic interventions are necessary in order to prevent muscle loss and associated physical decline in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that led to a global public health emergency causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It was initially identified in Wuhan, China after causing significant respiratory illness. Although respiratory symptoms are the most common presenting symptoms, it is now recognized that COVID-19 encompasses multiple organ systems including the cardiovascular system. Acute myocardial injury and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have now been associated with COVID-19. COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular manifestations are at risk for increased severity of illness. Here we present a case of a very young 27-year-old patient without any past history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, or any risk factors for coronary artery disease except obesity, who developed STEMI while in the hospital.

AB  - Significant aspects of COVID-19 pandemic remain obscure. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system, whose expression dominates on lung alveolar epithelial cells, is the human cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We strongly encourage the concept that thorough considerations of receptor-ligand interactions should be kept at the heart of scientific debate on infection. In this idea, the whole renin-angiotensin system has to be evaluated. We hypothesize that factors related to ethnicity, environment, behaviors, associated illness, and medications involving this complex system are probably responsible for situations regarded as anomalous from both an epidemiological and a clinical point of view, but, taken together, such factors may explain most of the aspects of current outbreak. We decided to use the analogy of a play and speculate about the possible impact in this tragedy of 1) air pollution via the interference of nitrogen dioxide on ACE2 expression; 2) the dual role of nicotine; 3) the hypothetical involvement of ACE2 polymorphisms, the relationships of which with ethnic factors and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease seems intriguing; 4) the impact on the severity of infection of hypertension and related medications acting on the renin/angiotensin system, and, finally, 5) the possible helpful role of chloroquine, thanks to its capacity of modifying ACE2 affinity to the viral spike protein by altering glycosylation. This hypothesis paper is an urgent call for the development of research programs that aim at questioning whether the putative protagonists of this tragedy are real-life actors in COVID-19.

AB  - The World Health Organization categorized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic due to its high contagion rate and widespread infectivity in February 2020. In the United States, one of the public health concerns is the adequacy of resources to treat infected cases. We describe a case of a previously well, 9-year-old obese boy who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath, fever, abdominal pain, and cough with chest pain. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 through significant family contact, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and found to be at high risk of venous thromboembolism due to abnormal d-dimer. Lung point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in the emergency department observed significant lung pathology, including pleural thickening, consolidation, and B lines. A chest X-ray found bilateral ground glass opacities and interstitial prominences consistent with viral pneumonia. Our case suggests that lung POCUS can provide adequate and rapid imaging to assess lung pathology of COVID-19 in a pediatric patient. As there is limited literature on use of lung POCUS in pediatric patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, our case emphasizes its function as a potentially efficient modality in bedside assessment.

AB  - No effective antiviral drugs and vaccines are available for the treatment of patients with severe coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, available, safe, and inexpensive drugs and supplements such as melatonin are among the proposed options for controlling inflammation. We did a randomized, single-blind study in Imam Khomeini Hospital between June 30, 2020, and August 5, 2020. Mild to moderate COVID-19 patients aged 25-65 years were eligible to enter the study based on chest CT scan, clinical symptoms, and physician diagnosis. The intervention group was prescribed 6 mg of oral melatonin for 2 weeks, which consumed half an hour before bedtime every night in low light conditions. Clinical symptoms and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured before and after treatment in the melatonin received and control (regular medications) groups. Among screened patients with COVID-19, 14 patients were assigned to receive melatonin, and 17 patients were considered as controls. A significant difference (p=0.005) between CRP 1 and CRP 2 levels (before and after using melatonin) was found in the melatonin group while this difference (p=0.069) was not significant in the control group. Also, the percentage of recovery (based on symptoms) in patients who took melatonin was higher than that of patients in the control group (85.7% VS 47.1%). The result of this study confirmed the effectiveness of melatonin in mild to moderate outpatients with COVID-19. More clinical trials on elderly, diabetic, obese patients and severe cases are suggested in future studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disproportionately impacted the African American community. This study aims to identify the risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease in African American patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of African American patients with COVID-19 treated between March 12 and April 9, 2020, at a single tertiary center. The primary outcome of interest was severe disease defined as those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: The study included 158 consecutive patients. The mean age was 57 years, and 61% were women. The mean (SD) of BMI was 33.2 (8.6) kg/m(2) . Overall, patients admitted to the ICU were older (62 vs. 55 years, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.003) and had higher BMI (36.5 kg/m(2) vs. 31.9 kg/m(2) , P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.002). In unadjusted and adjusted analysis, the factors most associated with ICU admission in this sample were age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.073; 95% CI: 1.033-1.114), BMI (aOR: 1.115; 95% CI: 1.052-1.182), and lung disease (aOR: 3.097; 95% CI: 1.137-8.437). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified risk factors for severe disease in COVID-19, specifically in an African American population. Further inclusive research aimed at optimizing clinical care relevant to the African American population is critical to ensure an equitable response to COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To confirm whether a relationship exists between male sex and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality and whether this relationship is age dependent. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We queried the COVID-19 Research Network, a multinational database using the TriNetX network, to identify patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The main end point of the study was all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 14,712 patients were included, of whom 6387 (43%) were men. Men were older (mean age, 55.0¬±17.7 years vs 51.1¬±17.9 years; P<.001) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, coronary disease, obstructive pulmonary disease, nicotine dependence, and heart failure but a lower prevalence of obesity. Before propensity score matching (PSM), all-cause mortality rate was 8.8% in men and 4.3% in women (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.87 to 2.46; P<.001) at a median follow-up duration of 34 and 32 days, respectively. In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the cumulative probability of survival was significantly lower in men than in women (73% vs 86%; log-rank, P<.001). After PSM, all-cause mortality remained significantly higher in men than in women (8.13% vs 4.60%; odds ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.55 to 2.11; P<.001). In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the cumulative probability of survival remained significantly lower in men than in women (74% vs 86%; log-rank, P<.001). The cumulative probability of survival remained significantly lower in propensity score-matched men than in women after excluding patients younger than 50 years and those who were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker medications on admission. CONCLUSION: Among patients with COVID-19 infection, men had a significantly higher mortality than did women, and this difference was not completely explained by the higher prevalence of comorbidities in men.

AB  - A 47-year-old non-smoker male who has received the first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in Saudi Arabia. At day 3 post-vaccination, he tested negative for Covid-19 and travelled to Egypt. On day 12 he developed runny nose, body ache and fever, and he reportedly tested (PCR) negative for Covid-19 Upon his return to Saudi on day 15, his symptoms have worsened and he presented to the Emergency Department, at which he tested positive for Covid-19. The patient was overweight (BMI = 29), was not suffering from any comorbidities and was not taking any medication. Upon examination, he was vitally stable and his laboratory investigation only revealed a slightly increased Creatinine. His chest X-ray was unremarkable. His condition did not require hospital admission, so he was discharged and advised to home-isolate himself. Four days after his discharge, his entire household came to the hospital and tested positive for Covid-19. This is the first case report, in Saudi Arabia, of a person receiving the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine and got infected with Covid-19 afterwards. The report highlights the significance of receiving the second dose of the vaccine to be effective. It also demonstrates that those with a single dose mRNA vaccine, could get infected and transmit the infection.

AB  - Previous studies have found a correlation between malnutrition and prognosis in respiratory infections. Our objectives were to determine (i) the percentage of malnutrition, and (ii) its prognosis in patients admitted for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this monocentric retrospective study, we consecutively included all adult patients presenting with acute COVID-19 between 9 April and 29 May 2020. Malnutrition was diagnosed on low body mass index (BMI) and weight loss ‚â• 5% in the previous month and/or ‚â•10% in the previous six months. The Nutritional Risk Index (NRI) defined nutritional risk. Severe COVID-19 was defined as a need for nasal oxygen ‚â• 6 L/min. We enrolled 108 patients (64 men, 62 ¬± 16 years, BMI 28.8 ¬± 6.2 kg/m(2)), including 34 (31.5%) with severe COVID-19. Malnutrition was found in 42 (38.9%) patients, and moderate or severe nutritional risk in 83 (84.7%) patients. Malnutrition was not associated with COVID-19 severity. Nutritional risk was associated with severe COVID-19 (p < 0.01; p < 0.01 after adjustment for C reactive protein), as were lower plasma proteins, albumin, prealbumin, and zinc levels (p < 0.01). The main cause of malnutrition was inflammation. The high percentage of malnutrition and the association between nutritional risk and COVID-19 prognosis supports international guidelines advising regular screening and nutritional support when necessary.

AB  - In October 2019, a viral infectious disease appeared in the city of Wuhan in China. A new betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been recognized as the responsible pathogen in this infection. Although coronavirus disease is principally expressed as a pulmonary infection, critical SARS-CoV-2 infection is frequently complicated with coagulopathy, and thromboembolic events are recognizable in several patients. Dehydration, acute inflammatory condition, protracted immobilization during disease, existence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, obesity or hypertension, previous coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease are frequent comorbidities in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized subjects, which possibly augment thrombo-embolic risk. However, other causal factors can still be identified such as unrestricted angiotensin II action, the use of immunoglobulins, an increased production of adhesion molecules able to induce vascular inflammation and endothelial activation, complement stimulation, excessive production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and increased platelet count. Low-molecular-weight heparin should be chosen as early treatment because of its anti-inflammatory action and its ability to antagonize histones and so defend the endothelium. However, several therapeutic possibilities have also been proposed such as fibrinolytic treatment, drugs that target NETs, and complement inhibition. Nevertheless, although the violence of the pandemic may suggest the use of heroic treatments to reduce the frightening mortality that accompanies SARS-CoV-2 infection, we believe that experimental treatments should only be used within approved and controlled protocols, the only ones that can provide useful and specify information on the validity of the treatments.

AB  - Studies have shown the negative impact of COVID-19 lockdown orders on mental health and substance use in the general population. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic onsubstance use, mental health and weight-related behaviors in a sample of adults with obesity after lockdown orders were lifted (June-September 2020). A retrospective medical chart review identified patients with obesity from one university-based obesity medicine clinic, and two metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) practices. Patients who completed an online survey from June 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020 were included. The primary outcome measure was substance use (various drugs, alcohol, tobacco). Substance use and mental health survey questions were based on standardized, validated instruments. A total of 589 patients (83.3% female, mean age 53.6 years [SD 12.8], mean BMI 35.4 [SD 9.1], 54.5% Non-Hispanic white, 22.3% post-MBS) were included. Seventeen patients (2.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 13.5% reported symptoms. Nearly half (48.4%) of the sample reported recreational substance use and 9.8% reported increased use since the start of the pandemic. There was substantial drug use reported (24.3% opioids, 9.5% sedative/tranquilizers, 3.6% marijuana, and 1% stimulants). Patients who reported stockpiling food more (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 1.50, 95% CI 1.03-2.18), healthy eating more challenging (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.01-2.16), difficulty falling asleep (aOR 1.64, 95% CI 1.14-2.34), and anxiety (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.01-2.14) were more likely to report substance use versus non-users. Results here show that the COVID-19 pandemic is having a deleterious impact on substance use, mental health and weight-related health behaviors in people with obesity regardless of infection status.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The science of telemedicine has shown great advances over the past decade. However, the field needs to better understand if a change in care delivery from in-person to telehealth as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic will yield durable patient engagement and health outcomes for patients with obesity. The objective of this study was to examine the association of mode of healthcare utilization (telehealth versus in-person) and sociodemographic factors among patients with obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective medical chart review identified patients with obesity from a university outpatient obesity medicine clinic and a community bariatric surgery practice. Patients completed an online survey (1 June 2020-24 September 2020) to assess changes in healthcare utilization modality during subsequent changes in infection rates in the geographic area. Logistic regression analysis examined the association of mode of healthcare utilization and key sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 583 patients (87% female, mean age 51.2 years (standard deviation 13.0), mean body mass index 40.2 (standard deviation 6.7), 49.2% non-Hispanic white, 28.7% non-Hispanic black, 16.4% Hispanic, 7% other ethnicity, 33.1% completed bariatric surgery) were included. Adjusted logistic regression models showed older age was inversely associated with telehealth use (adjusted odds ratio‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.98) and non-Hispanic black were more likely to use telehealth compared to non-Hispanic white (adjusted odds ratio‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.05-2.81). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting access to healthcare among patients with obesity. Telehealth is an emerging modality that can maintain healthcare access during the pandemic, but utilization varies by age and ethnicity in this high-risk population.

AB  - How the impact of the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders is influencing physical, mental and financial health among vulnerable populations, including those with obesity is unknown. The aim of the current study was to explore the health implications of COVID-19 among a sample of adults with obesity. A retrospective medical chart review identified patients with obesity from an obesity medicine clinic and a bariatric surgery (MBS) practice. Patients completed an online survey from April 15, 2020 to May 31, 2020 to assess COVID-19 status and health behaviours during stay-at-home orders. Logistic regression models examined the impact of these orders on anxiety and depression by ethnic group. A total of 123 patients (87% female, mean age 51.2‚Äâyears [SD 13.0]), mean BMI 40.2 [SD 6.7], 49.2% non-Hispanic white (NHW), 28.7% non-Hispanic black, 16.4% Hispanic, 7% other ethnicity and 33.1% completed MBS were included. Two patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and 14.6% reported symptoms. Then, 72.8% reported increased anxiety and 83.6% increased depression since stay-at-home orders were initiated. Also 69.6% reported more difficultly in achieving weight loss goals, less exercise time (47.9%) and intensity (55.8%), increased stockpiling of food (49.6%) and stress eating (61.2%). Hispanics were less likely to report anxiety vs NHWs (adjusted odds ratios 0.16; 95% CI, 0.05-0.49; P =‚Äâ.009). Results here showed the COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on patients with obesity regardless of infection status. These results can inform clinicians and healthcare professionals about effective strategies to minimize COVID-19 negative outcomes for this vulnerable population now and in post-COVID-19 recovery efforts.

AB  - It is widely believed that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus triggers a disproportionate immune response which causes a devastating systemic injury, particularly in individuals with obesity, itself a chronic, multi-organ inflammatory disease. Immune cells accumulate in visceral adipose tissue and together with paracrine adipocytes release a wide range of biologically active cytokines (including IL-1Œ≤, IL5, IL6 and IL8) that can result in both local, pulmonary and systemic inflammation. A more intense 'cytokine storm' is postulated as the mechanism behind the extreme immune response seen in severe COVID-19. It is striking how dangerous the combination of obesity and COVID-19 is, resulting in a greater risk of ICU admission and a higher mortality. Furthermore, patients from a BAME background appear to have increased mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection; they also have a higher prevalence of central obesity and its metabolic complications. In the absence of an effective vaccine, the therapeutic potential of immune-modulating drugs is a priority, but the development of new drugs is expensive and time-consuming. A more pragmatic solution would be to seek to repurpose existing drugs, particularly those that might suppress the heightened cytokine activity seen in obesity, the major risk factor for a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist licensed to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis. It has been shown to diminish pulmonary response to antigen, tissue eosinophilia and IL-5 expression in inflammatory cells. It has also been shown to decrease elevated levels of IL-1Œ≤ and IL8 in humans with viral upper respiratory tract infections compared with placebo-treated patients. In addition, in silico studies have demonstrated a high binding affinity of the montelukast molecule to the terminal site of the virus's main protease enzyme which is needed for virus RNA synthesis and replication. Montelukast, which is cheap, safe and widely available would appear to have the potential to be an ideal candidate drug for clinical trials, particularly in early stage disease before irreparable tissue damage has already occurred. HYPOTHESIS: Through a direct anti-viral effect, or by suppression of heightened cytokine release in response to SARS-CoV-2, montelukast will reduce the severity of immune-mediated multiorgan damage resulting from COVID-19, particularly in patients with central obesity and metabolic syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has compelled implementing confinement measure across the globe. These measures can potentially lead to many changes in lifestyle. However, no studies examined the effect of COVID-19-induced confinement on physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB). METHODS: During April and May of 2020, the current study surveyed changes in PA and SB induced by COVID-19 confinement. RESULTS: The participants of the study were 1844. Among the participants who were regularly involved in PA, the majority (41.8-42.2%) of the participants reported a "decrease" (p<0.05) in walking, jogging, and sports while the majority (46.3-53.1%) reported a "no change" (p<0.05) in swimming, cycling, and weight lifting. With regard to the SB, most of the participants reported an "increase" in watching TV (72.3%), using electronics (82.7%), and logging to social media (81.9%). Additionally, gender, job type, obesity, and being worried to contract the disease were associated (p<0.05) with changes in PA. On the other hand, age, gender, obesity, job type and income were related (p<0.05) to changes in SB. CONCLUSION: Results of the current study might enhance knowledge about the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle, particularly PA and SB. Subsequently, it can also be used to establish strategies to enhance engagement in activities during the current and future pandemics.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has been associated with both endotoxemia and thrombosis of small and large vessels, but the relationship between these 2 phenomena has not been pursued. Oliva et al. in this issue of Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology demonstrate an association between the 2 findings and suggest that increased intestinal permeability is a possible mechanism to explain the endotoxemia. Although the evidence to support this hypothesis is only suggestive, the role of the small intestine in the illness produced by the virus needs to be further explored.

AB  - The fast spread of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) calls for immediate action to counter the associated significant loss of human life and deep economic impact. Certain patient populations like those with obesity and diabetes are at higher risk for acquiring severe COVID-19 disease and have a higher risk of COVID-19 associated mortality. In the absence of an effective and safe vaccine, the only immediate promising approach is to repurpose an existing approved drug. Several drugs have been proposed and tested as adjunctive therapy for COVID-19. Among these drugs are the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 2 agonists and the dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Beyond their glucose-lowering effects, these drugs have several pleiotropic protective properties, which include cardioprotective effects, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities, antifibrotic effects, antithrombotic effects, and vascular endothelial protective properties. This narrative review discusses these protective properties and addresses their scientific plausibility for their potential use as adjunctive therapy for COVID-19 disease.

AB  - Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes critical disease in approximately 5% of affected patients, particularly the elderly, hypertensive, obese and immunocompromised. Patients with haematological cancer, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), are particularly at risk of complications. Very rarely, patients with extreme leukocytosis may develop spurious hypoxemia, or pseudohypoxemia, which confuses the diagnosis of complications and can lead to intervention errors. We report the case of a patient with CLL, severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 and pseudohypoxemia. LEARNING POINTS: Patients with haematological neoplasms are susceptible to viral, bacterial and fungal infections, and are thus at risk of COVID-19.Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia may rarely, due to a high lymphocyte count, present with spurious, or in vitro, hypoxemia.The clinician must identify and properly treat such cases to prevent any unnecessary treatments and their complications.

AB  - We investigated how emotional responses (positive and negative affect), physical activity (PA), and sedentary behaviors related to anxiety among US children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sixty-four typically-developing children (63% girls) age 9-15 years old completed two virtual visits during height of "stay-at-home" measures between April 22 - July 29, 2020. Children completed 24-hour PA recalls, state portion of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), and the shortened 10-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children (PANAS-C). Children reported state anxiety scores that were more than 5 standard deviations greater than values from healthy pediatric populations prior to the pandemic. Children with higher positive affect and who reported more time in PA reported less state anxiety. Sedentary and leisure screen time were positively correlated with negative affect. Our findings suggest that maintaining positive affect, engaging in PA, and limiting leisure screen time may be important for child mental health during stressful periods. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: There is increasing concern regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the psychological and physical health of children. To date, studies on mental health during the pandemic in children are limited. We investigated links between activity levels and psychological outcomes in children during the height of the "stay-at-home" measures. We found that children had anxiety scores that were more than 5 standard deviations greater than normative values from healthy pediatric populations prior to the pandemic, and 94% of children exceeded the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations on leisure screen time. Positive affect and physical activity were associated with reduced anxiety levels in children during the pandemic. These findings highlight the important mental health benefits of maintaining positive affect, engaging in physical activity, and limiting leisure screen time for children, especially during stressful periods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with adverse child mental health outcomes and reduced physical activity. Moreover, prenatal exposure to gestational diabetes (GDM) is associated with increased risk for adverse psychological outcomes in children. OBJECTIVES: Assess prenatal exposure to GDM on anxiety levels and physical activity in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Sixty-five children age 9 to 15 reported their physical activity and anxiety levels using the 24-hours physical activity recall and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children via phone or video meetings. Prenatal exposure to GDM was obtained from maternal electronic medical records. RESULTS: The 38 GDM-exposed children reported significantly higher anxiety levels and were less likely to engage in any vigorous physical activity (VPA) (5% vs 30%) compared to the 27 GDM-unexposed children. Lower levels of physical activity were significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety. Less engagement in VPA explained 75% of the association between GDM exposure and anxiety levels. CONCLUSIONS: Engaging in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic may be beneficial for reducing anxiety, particularly amongst GDM-exposed children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is concern regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the psychological and physical health of children, but to date, studies on mental health during the pandemic in children are limited. Furthermore, unprecedented lifestyle stressors associated with the pandemic may aggravate the childhood obesity epidemic, but the role of BMI on child activity levels and psychological outcomes during COVID-19 is unknown. OBJECTIVES: We investigated how emotional responses (positive/negative affect), physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviours related to anxiety among U.S. children with healthy weight and overweight/obesity during the pandemic. METHODS: Sixty-four typically developing children (63% girls, 53% healthy weight) aged 9 to 15‚Äâyears completed two virtual visits during the height of 'stay-at-home' measures from April 22 to July 29, 2020. Children completed 24-hours PA recalls, state portion of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children and the 10-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children. RESULTS: Independent of child BMI status, child anxiety scores were over five standard deviations greater than normative values from paediatric populations prior to the pandemic. Higher positive affect and PA were each associated with reduced anxiety levels in children with overweight/obesity, whereas higher positive affect was associated with reduced anxiety in children with healthy weight. Greater leisure screen time was associated with higher negative affect irrespective of child BMI status. CONCLUSIONS: These associations highlight the potential mental health benefits of maintaining positive affect, engaging in PA and limiting leisure screen time for children during the pandemic and suggest that these associations may be particularly relevant for children with overweight/obesity.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Evidence suggests the existence of an association between the institution of nutritional therapy and clinical outcomes in patients with critical COVID-19. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of nutritional assistance on COVID-19 mortality in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU). METHODS: This is a subset of the cohort "Influence of nutritional therapy on clinical prognosis in patients with COVID-19: a multicenter retrospective cohort study". Clinical and nutrition assistance information (type of assistance, evaluation of anthropometric status, and time of introduction of nutritional therapy) and presence of diabetes, hypertension and previous respiratory disease were collected from electronic medical records. To evaluate the association between the variables of interest and mortality, the hazard ratio was estimated. RESULTS: We evaluated 153 critically ill patients ‚â•18 years old, affected by COVID-19, with a rate of mortality of 77.8%. Among non survivors 58.8% were female, 52.9% aged <65 years, 66.4% had arterial hypertension, 46.2% diabetes mellitus and 81.5% had an early onset of nutritional support. Initiation of nutritional therapy after 48¬†h (HR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.57-4.20) and the presence of obesity (HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.04-2.31) were associated with higher mortality, even after adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that the provision of early nutritional therapy should be prioritized, with greater attention directed to obese patients, and the nutritional assistance can contribute favorably to the clinical evolution and prognosis of critically ill patients with COVID-19.

AB  - The devastating pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused thousands of deaths and left millions of restless patients suffering from its complications. Increasing data indicate that the disease presents in a severe form in patients with pre-existing chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory system diseases, and renal diseases. This denotes that these patients are more susceptible to COVID-19 and have higher mortality rates compared to patients with no comorbid conditions. Several factors can explain the heightened susceptibility and fatal presentation of COVID-19 in these patients, for example, the enhanced expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in specific organs, cytokine storm, and drug interactions contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality. Adding to the findings that individuals with pre-existing conditions may be more susceptible to COVID-19, it has also been shown that COVID-19 can induce chronic diseases in previously healthy patients. Therefore, understanding the interlinked relationship between COVID-19 and chronic diseases helps in optimizing the management of susceptible patients. This review comprehensively described the molecular mechanisms that contribute to worse COVID-19 prognosis in patients with pre-existing comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal and renal diseases, blood disorders, autoimmune diseases, and finally, obesity. It also focused on how COVID-19 could, in some cases, lead to chronic conditions as a result of long-term multi-organ damage. Lastly, this work carefully discussed the tailored management plans for each specific patient population, aiming to achieve the best therapeutic outcome with minimum complications.

AB  - Flavonoids are a class of phenolic natural products, well-identified in traditional and modern medicines in the treatment of several diseases including viral infection. Flavonoids showed potential inhibitory activity against coronaviruses including the current pandemic outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and designated as COVID-19. Here, we have collected all data related to the potential inhibitory mechanisms of flavonoids against SARS-CoV-2 infection and their significant immunomodulatory activities. The data were mapped and compared to elect major flavonoids with a promising role in the current pandemic. Further, we have linked the global existence of flavonoids in medicinal plants and their role in protection against COVID-19. Computational analysis predicted that flavonoids can exhibit potential inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 by binding to essential viral targets required in virus entry and/ or replication. Flavonoids also showed excellent immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities including the inhibition of various inflammatory cytokines. Further, flavonoids showed significant ability to reduce the exacerbation of COVID-19 in the case of obesity via promoting lipids metabolism. Moreover, flavonoids exhibit a high safety profile, suitable bioavailability, and no significant adverse effects. For instance, plants rich in flavonoids are globally distributed and can offer great protection from COVID-19. The data described in this study strongly highlighted that flavonoids particularly quercetin and luteolin can exhibit promising multi-target activity against SARS-CoV-2, which promote their use in the current and expected future outbreaks. Therefore, a regimen of flavonoid-rich plants can be recommended to supplement a sufficient amount of flavonoids for the protection and treatment from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the provisions implemented to contain the spread of Covid-19 infections in Italy was the lockdown. Effects of the lockdown on childbirth outcomes and on the well-being of both the mother and the child have not yet been defined. An inadequate diet during pregnancy and a reduced physical activity can predispose women to become overweight or obese and trigger the development of various complications and maternal-fetal adverse outcomes. METHODS: This is a retrospective study including all consecutive patients who delivered at University Hospital Maggiore della Carit√† in Novara, Italy, in April-May 2017 (group 1, n=294), a period prior to the pandemic, and during the same months in 2020 (group 2, n=256) during and immediately after lockdown. Clinical data were extracted from The Report "Childbirth Assistance Certificate (CedAP) - Birth Event Analysis". RESULTS: Demographic characteristics were similar between the two study groups, except for a decreased number of married couples in group 2 (p-value 0.018) and an increased percentage of patients with clinical checkups at Family Planning facilities in 2020 (p-value 0.04). The number of hospitalizations during pregnancy was 26 (8.9%) vs 10 (3.9%) with a significative reduction during 2020 (p-value 0.004). Regarding obstetric outcomes, we observed a significant increase in induction of labour in 2020 (23.9% vs 35.9%; p-value 0. 002), a reduction of amniorrhexis (11.3% vs 5.5% p-value 0.015), a reduction of supine positions with an increase of vertical and all fours positions in 2020 (49.3% vs 61.9% and 9.5% vs 12.4% respectively, p 0.023), and a reduction of left occipito-anterior presented part (63.2% vs 55.4%) in favor of right occipito-anterior (34.7% vs 41.2%, p-value 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences either for antepartum or intrapartum complications. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate psychological, behavioral, and epigenetic effects of maternal physical inactivity on obstetric outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The major complication of COVID-19 is hypoxaemic respiratory failure from capillary leak and alveolar oedema. Experimental and early clinical data suggest that the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor imatinib reverses pulmonary capillary leak. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial was done at 13 academic and non-academic teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Hospitalised patients (aged ‚â•18 years) with COVID-19, as confirmed by an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, requiring supplemental oxygen to maintain a peripheral oxygen saturation of greater than 94% were eligible. Patients were excluded if they had severe pre-existing pulmonary disease, had pre-existing heart failure, had undergone active treatment of a haematological or non-haematological malignancy in the previous 12 months, had cytopenia, or were receiving concomitant treatment with medication known to strongly interact with imatinib. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral imatinib, given as a loading dose of 800 mg on day 0 followed by 400 mg daily on days 1-9, or placebo. Randomisation was done with a computer-based clinical data management platform with variable block sizes (containing two, four, or six patients), stratified by study site. The primary outcome was time to discontinuation of mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen for more than 48 consecutive hours, while being alive during a 28-day period. Secondary outcomes included safety, mortality at 28 days, and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. All efficacy and safety analyses were done in all randomised patients who had received at least one dose of study medication (modified intention-to-treat population). This study is registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2020-001236-10). FINDINGS: Between March 31, 2020, and Jan 4, 2021, 805 patients were screened, of whom 400 were eligible and randomly assigned to the imatinib group (n=204) or the placebo group (n=196). A total of 385 (96%) patients (median age 64 years [IQR 56-73]) received at least one dose of study medication and were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. Time to discontinuation of ventilation and supplemental oxygen for more than 48 h was not significantly different between the two groups (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0¬∑95 [95% CI 0¬∑76-1¬∑20]). At day 28, 15 (8%) of 197 patients had died in the imatinib group compared with 27 (14%) of 188 patients in the placebo group (unadjusted HR 0¬∑51 [0¬∑27-0¬∑95]). After adjusting for baseline imbalances between the two groups (sex, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) the HR for mortality was 0¬∑52 (95% CI 0¬∑26-1¬∑05). The HR for mechanical ventilation in the imatinib group compared with the placebo group was 1¬∑07 (0¬∑63-1¬∑80; p=0¬∑81). The median duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 7 days (IQR 3-13) in the imatinib group compared with 12 days (6-20) in the placebo group (p=0¬∑0080). 91 (46%) of 197 patients in the imatinib group and 82 (44%) of 188 patients in the placebo group had at least one grade 3 or higher adverse event. The safety evaluation revealed no imatinib-associated adverse events. INTERPRETATION: The study failed to meet its primary outcome, as imatinib did not reduce the time to discontinuation of ventilation and supplemental oxygen for more than 48 consecutive hours in patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The observed effects on survival (although attenuated after adjustment for baseline imbalances) and duration of mechanical ventilation suggest that imatinib might confer clinical benefit in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, but further studies are required to validate these findings.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is continuously affecting the lives of all people. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy in terms of morbidity, mortality, and perinatal maternal and fetal outcomes is essential to propose strategies for prevention and infection control. Here, we conducted a systematic review to investigate pregnant women infected with COVID-19 in terms of signs and symptoms, type of delivery, comorbidities, maternal and neonatal outcomes, and the possibility of vertical transmission. A search on Embase and PubMed databases was performed on 31 October 2020. Observational studies and case reports on pregnant women infected with COVID-19 were included without language restrictions. The 70 selected studies included a total of 1457 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 in the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy. The most common signs and symptoms were fever, cough, and nausea. The most frequent comorbidities were obesity, hypertensive disorders, and gestational diabetes. Among maternal and fetal outcomes, premature birth (n = 64), maternal death (n = 15), intrauterine fetal death or neonatal death (n = 16), cases of intrauterine fetal distress (n = 28), miscarriage (n = 7), decreased fetal movements (n = 19), and severe neonatal asphyxia (n = 5) were the most frequent. Thirty-nine newborns tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was detected in the placenta (n = 13) and breast milk (n = 6). This review indicates that COVID-19 during pregnancy can result in maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 viral exposure of neonates during pregnancy and delivery cannot be ruled out. Thus, we highlight the need for long-term follow-up of newborns from mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 to establish the full implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in these children.

AB  - COVID-19 has had a calamitous effect on the global community. Despite intense study, the immunologic response to the infection is only partially understood. In addition to older age and ethnicity, patients with comorbidities including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, malignancy, renal, and pulmonary disease may experience severe outcomes. Some patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) and secondary immunodeficiency also appear to be at increased risk from COVID-19. In addition to vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2, patients with PIDs often have chronic pulmonary disease and may not respond to vaccines, which exacerbates their long-term risk. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders, the most frequent symptomatic PID in adults and children, have a spectrum of B- and T-cell defects. It may be possible to stratify their risk for severe COVID-19 based on age, ethnicity, the severity of the T-cell defect, and the presence of other comorbidities. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders and other immunodeficiencies are at risk for Chronic COVID-19, a dangerous stalemate between a suboptimal immune response and SARS-CoV-2. Intra-host viral evolution could result in the rapid emergence of vaccine-resistant mutants and variants of high consequence; it is a public health emergency. Vaccination and prevention of Chronic COVID-19 in immunodeficient patients is therefore of the utmost priority. Having a reliable diagnostic assay for T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for evaluating responses to vaccines in these patients. New treatments for SARS-CoV-2 such as NZACE2-PƒÅtari are likely to be particularly beneficial for immunodeficient patients, especially those who fail to mount a robust T-cell response to COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - An influenza-like virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for COVID-19 disease and spread worldwide within a short time. COVID-19 has now become a significant concern for public health. Obesity is highly prevalent worldwide and is considered a risk factor for impairing the adaptive immune system. Although diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and renal failure are considered the risk factors for COVID-19, obesity is not yet well-considered. The present study approaches establishing a systemic association between the prevalence of obesity and its impact on immunity concerning the severe outcomes of COVID-19 utilizing existing knowledge. Overall study outcomes documented the worldwide prevalence of obesity, its effects on immunity, and a possible underlying mechanism covering obesity-related risk pathways for the severe outcomes of COVID-19. Overall understanding from the present study is that being an immune system impairing factor, the role of obesity in the severe outcomes of COVID-19 is worthy.

AB  - Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and mortality. However, it is not known whether patients with obesity are at a greater risk of developing postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). In a median follow-up time of 8¬†months and counting from 30‚Äâdays following a positive viral test of 2839 patients who did not require intensive care unit admission and survived the acute phase of COVID-19, 1230 (43%) patients required medical diagnostic tests, 1255 (44%) patients underwent hospital admission, and 29 (1%) patients died. Compared with patients with a normal body mass index (BMI), the risk of hospital admission was 28% and 30% higher in patients with moderate and severe obesity, respectively. The need for diagnostic tests to assess different medical problems, compared with patients with normal BMI, was 25% and 39% higher in patients with moderate and severe obesity, respectively. The findings of this study suggest that moderate and severe obesity (BMI ‚â•‚Äâ35 kg/m(2) ) are associated with a greater risk of PASC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for poor clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between prior metabolic surgery and the severity of COVID-19 in patients with severe obesity. SETTING: Cleveland Clinic Health System in the United States. METHODS: Among 4365 patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between March 8, 2020 and July 22, 2020 in the Cleveland Clinic Health System,¬†33 patients were identified who had a prior history of metabolic surgery. The surgical patients were propensity matched 1:10 to nonsurgical patients to assemble a cohort of control patients (n¬†= 330) with a body mass index (BMI) ‚â• 40 kg/m(2) at the time of SARS-CoV-2 testing. The primary endpoint was the rate of hospital admission. The exploratory endpoints included admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation and dialysis during index hospitalization, and mortality. After propensity score matching, outcomes were compared in univariate and multivariate regression models. RESULTS: The average BMI of the surgical group was 49.1 ¬± 8.8 kg/m(2) before metabolic surgery and was down to 37.2 ¬± 7.1 at the time of SARS-CoV-2 testing, compared with the control group's BMI of 46.7 ¬± 6.4 kg/m(2). In the univariate analysis, 6 (18.2%) patients in the metabolic surgery group and 139 (42.1%) patients in the control group were admitted to the hospital (P = .013). In the multivariate analysis, a prior history of metabolic surgery was associated with a lower hospital admission rate compared with control patients with obesity (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.88; P = .028). While none of the 4 exploratory outcomes occurred in the metabolic surgery group, 43 (13.0%) patients in the control group required ICU admission (P = .021), 22 (6.7%) required mechanical ventilation, 5 (1.5%) required dialysis, and 8 (2.4%) patients died. CONCLUSION: Prior metabolic surgery with subsequent weight loss and improvement of metabolic abnormalities was associated with lower rates of hospital and ICU admission in patients with obesity who became infected with SARS-CoV-2. Confirmation of these findings will require larger studies.

AB  - There is no data on patients with severe obesity who developed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after bariatric surgery. Four gastric bypass operations, performed in a 2-week period between Feb 24 and March 4, 2020, in Tehran, Iran, were complicated with COVID-19. The mean age and body mass index were 46‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ12¬†years and 49‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3¬†kg/m(2). Patients developed their symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue) 1, 2, 4, and 14¬†days after surgery. One patient had unnoticed anosmia 2 days before surgery. Three patients were readmitted in hospital. All 4 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine. In two patients who required admission in intensive care unit, other off-label therapies including antiretroviral and immunosuppressive agents were also administered. All patients survived. In conclusion, COVID-19 can complicate the postoperative course of patients after bariatric surgery. Correct diagnosis and management in the postoperative setting would be challenging. Timing of infection after surgery in our series would raise the possibility of hospital transmission of COVID-19: from asymptomatic patients at the time of bariatric surgery to the healthcare workers versus acquiring the COVID-19 infection by non-infected patients in the perioperative period.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Obesity worsens clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to measure the association between history of bariatric surgery and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: Data source included PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and pre-print servers between January and November 1, 2020. Literature was screened and selected to extract the relevant data. The two outcomes of this meta-analysis were the difference in mortality and hospitalization rates in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with and without history of bariatric surgery. Random-effect models were used to estimate the pooled effects. RESULTS: The systematic review yielded 3 retrospective studies on 9022 patients. The risk of mortality without previous bariatric surgery was 133 per 1000 cases and its risk with previous bariatric surgery was 33 per 1000 (summary OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.19-0.26). No heterogeneity was observed between the included studies (I(2)‚Äâ=‚Äâ0%, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.98 for heterogeneity). In the pooled analysis, the hospitalization rate in patients without previous bariatric surgery was 412 per 1000 cases and its rate in patients with previous bariatric surgery was 164 per 1000 (summary OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12-0.65). No heterogeneity was observed between the included studies (I(2)‚Äâ=‚Äâ0%, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.71 for heterogeneity). There was a substantial risk of bias across the studies for confounding and selection bias. CONCLUSION: Findings of this meta-analysis of observational studies suggest that prior bariatric surgery is associated with a lower rate of mortality and hospital admission in patients with obesity who become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Confirmation of these findings will require larger studies with better quality data.

AB  - Lasting immunity will be critical for overcoming the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, factors that drive the development of high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and how long those antibodies persist remain unclear. Our objective was to comprehensively evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a clinically diverse COVID-19 convalescent cohort at defined time points to determine if anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist and to identify clinical and demographic factors that correlate with high titers. Using a novel multiplex assay to quantify IgG against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens, a receptor binding domain-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 inhibition assay, and a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay, we found that 98% of COVID-19 convalescent subjects had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies five weeks after symptom resolution (n=113). Further, antibody levels did not decline three months after symptom resolution (n=79). As expected, greater disease severity, older age, male sex, obesity, and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score correlated with increased anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. We demonstrated for the first time that COVID-19 symptoms, namely fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and low appetite, correlated consistently with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Our results provide new insights into the development and persistence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

AB  - The newly emergent novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, has posed a serious threat to global public health and caused worldwide social and economic breakdown. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is expressed in human vascular endothelium, respiratory epithelium, and other cell types, and is thought to be a primary mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection. In physiological condition, ACE2 via its carboxypeptidase activity generates angiotensin fragments (Ang 1-9 and Ang 1-7), and plays an essential role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is a critical regulator of cardiovascular homeostasis. SARS-CoV-2 via its surface spike glycoprotein interacts with ACE2 and invades the host cells. Once inside the host cells, SARS-CoV-2 induces acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), stimulates immune response (i.e., cytokine storm) and vascular damage. SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial cell injury could exacerbate endothelial dysfunction, which is a hallmark of aging, hypertension, and obesity, leading to further complications. The pathophysiology of endothelial dysfunction and injury offers insights into COVID-19 associated mortality. Here we reviewed the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the roles of ACE2, RAS signaling, and a possible link between the pre-existing endothelial dysfunction and SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial injury in COVID-19 associated mortality. We also surveyed the roles of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), including CD209L/L-SIGN and CD209/DC-SIGN in SARS-CoV-2 infection and other related viruses. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of infection, the vascular damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 and pathways involved in the regulation of endothelial dysfunction could lead to new therapeutic strategies against COVID-19.

AB  - AIM: Examining the credibility of self-reported height, weight, and blood pressure by the elderly population using a tablet in a retirement residence, and examining the influence of health beliefs on the self-reporting credibility. BACKGROUND: Obesity is a major problem with rising prevalence in the western world. Hypertension is also a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Self-report, remotely from the clinic, becomes even more essential when patients are encouraged to avoid visiting the clinic as during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-reporting of height and weight is suspected of leading to underestimation of obesity prevalence in the population; however, it has not been well studied in the elderly population.The Health Belief Model tries to predict and explain decision making of patients based on the patient's health beliefs. METHODS: Residents of a retirement home network filled a questionnaire about their health beliefs regarding hypertension and obesity and self-reported their height, weight, and blood pressure. Blood pressure, height, and weight were then measured and compared to the patients' self-reporting. FINDINGS: Ninety residents, aged 84.90¬†¬±¬†5.88, filled the questionnaire. From a clinical perspective, the overall gap between the measured and the self-reported BMI (M¬†=¬†1.43, SD¬†=¬†2.72), which represents an absolute gap of 0.74¬†kilograms and 2.95¬†centimeters, is expected to have only a mild influence on the physician's clinical evaluation of the patient's medical condition. This can allow the physician to estimate their patient's BMI status before the medical consultation and physical examination upon the patient's self-reporting. Patients' dichotomous (normal/abnormal) self-report of their blood pressure condition was relatively credible: positive predictive value (PPV) of 77.78% for normal blood pressure (BP) and 78.57% for abnormal BP. The relatively high PPV of BP self-reporting demonstrates an option for the physician to recognize patients at risk. Regression analysis found no correlation between the anthropometric parameters and the Health Belief Model.

AB  - PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States led to nationwide stay-at-home orders and school closures. Declines in energy expenditure resulting from canceled physical education classes and reduced physical activity may elevate childhood obesity risk. This study estimated the impact of COVID-19 on childhood obesity. METHODS: A microsimulation model simulated the trajectory of a nationally representative kindergarten cohort's body mass index z-scores and childhood obesity prevalence from April 2020 to March 2021 under the control scenario without COVID-19 and under the 4 alternative scenarios with COVID-19-Scenario 1: 2-month nationwide school closure in April and May 2020; Scenario 2: Scenario 1 followed by a 10% reduction in daily physical activity in the summer from June to August; Scenario 3: Scenario 2 followed by 2-month school closure in September and October; and Scenario 4: Scenario 3 followed by an additional 2-month school closure in November and December. RESULTS: Relative to the control scenario without COVID-19, Scenarios 1, 2, 3, and 4 were associated with an increase in the mean body mass index z-scores by 0.056 (95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.055-0.056), 0.084 (95%CI: 0.084-0.085), 0.141 (95%CI: 0.140-0.142), and 0.198 (95%CI: 0.197-0.199), respectively, and an increase in childhood obesity prevalence by 0.640 (95%CI: 0.515-0.765), 0.972 (95%CI: 0.819-1.126), 1.676 (95%CI: 1.475-1.877), and 2.373 (95%CI: 2.135-2.612) percentage points, respectively. Compared to girls and non-Hispanic whites and Asians, the impact of COVID-19 on childhood obesity was modestly larger among boys and non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics, respectively. CONCLUSION: Public health interventions are urgently called to promote an active lifestyle and engagement in physical activity among children to mitigate the adverse impact of COVID-19 on unhealthy weight gains and childhood obesity.

AB  - Obesity continues to be a global issue. In recent years, researchers have started to question the role of our novel yet ubiquitous use of digital media in the development of obesity. With the recent COVID-19 outbreak affecting almost all aspects of society, many people have moved their social eating activities into the digital space, making the question as relevant as ever. The bombardment of appetizing food images and photography - colloquially referred to as "food porn" - has become a significant aspect of the digital food experience. This review presents an overview of whether and how the (1) viewing, (2) creating, and (3) online sharing of digital food photography can influence consumer eating behavior. Moreover, this review provides an outlook of future research opportunities, both to close the gaps in our scientific understanding of the physiological and psychological interaction between digital food photography and actual eating behavior, and, from a practical viewpoint, to optimize our digital food media habits to support an obesity-preventive lifestyle. We do not want to rest on the idea that food imagery's current prevalence is a core negative influence per se. Instead, we offer the view that active participation in food photography, in conjunction with a selective use of food-related digital media, might contribute to healthy body weight management and enhanced meal pleasure.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the number of patients with idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) who have contracted coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the impact of the pandemic on patients' attitudes on seeking help and attending hospitals, as well as the delays in the offer of treatment from the local health care systems. METHODS: A 29-question survey was distributed to an international mailing list of patients with subglottic stenosis to assess the patient experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 543 patients with iSGS participated. Fewer than 1 in 10 patients with iSGS have experienced COVID-19 symptoms, which were predominantly mild to moderate, with only 2 hospitalizations. Most patients with iSGS (80.0%) have not been advised they are high risk for COVID-19, despite 36.5% of patients with iSGS being obese (body mass index of 30+). Delays to surgeries and in-office procedures have impacted 40.1% of patients currently receiving treatment, with 38.8% of patients increasingly struggling to breathe as a result. Anxiety and stress are increasing among patients, with 3 in 4 (75.2%) reporting they are anxious about travelling by public transport, contracting the virus in hospital and infecting loved ones (69.0% and 71.9%, respectively). Of greater concern is that 23.1% with increasing dyspnea state they are staying away from hospital despite their deteriorating health. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the physical and psychological health of patients with iSGS. Surgeons managing cases of laryngotracheal stenosis need to offer appropriate support and communication to these high risk patients. During the pandemic, this should include self-isolation if they are dyspneic or on treatments that may have reduced their immunity. In addition, they should offer safe clinical pathways to airway assessment and treatments, if they become necessary. To minimize unnecessary travel, much of the clinical monitoring can be carried out remotely, using telephone or video-based consultations, in conjunction with local health professionals.

AB  - The metabolism of tryptophan is intimately associated with the differential regulation of diverse physiological processes, including in the regulation of responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that underpins the COVID-19 pandemic. Two important products of tryptophan metabolism, viz kynurenine and interleukin (IL)4-inducible1 (IL41)-driven indole 3 pyruvate (I3P), activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), thereby altering the nature of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. AhR activation dysregulates the initial pro-inflammatory cytokines production driven by neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells, whilst AhR activation suppresses the endogenous antiviral responses of natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells. Such immune responses become further dysregulated by the increased and prolonged pro-inflammatory cytokine suppression of pineal melatonin production coupled to increased gut dysbiosis and gut permeability. The suppression of pineal melatonin and gut microbiome-derived butyrate, coupled to an increase in circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) further dysregulates the immune response. The AhR mediates its effects via alterations in the regulation of mitochondrial function in immune cells. The increased risk of severe/fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection by high risk conditions, such as elderly age, obesity, and diabetes are mediated by these conditions having expression levels of melatonin, AhR, butyrate, and LPS that are closer to those driven by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This has a number of future research and treatment implications, including the utilization of melatonin and nutraceuticals that inhibit the AhR, including the polyphenols, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and resveratrol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether obesity is associated with intubation or death, inflammation, cardiac injury, or fibrinolysis in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A quaternary academic medical center and community hospital in New York City. PARTICIPANTS: 2466 adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection over a 45-day period with at least 47 days of in-hospital observation. MEASUREMENTS: Body mass index (BMI), admission biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]), cardiac injury (troponin level), and fibrinolysis (D-dimer level). The primary end point was a composite of intubation or death in time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: Over a median hospital length of stay of 7 days (interquartile range, 3 to 14 days), 533 patients (22%) were intubated, 627 (25%) died, and 59 (2%) remained hospitalized. Compared with overweight patients, patients with obesity had higher risk for intubation or death, with the highest risk among those with class 3 obesity (hazard ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1 to 2.1]). This association was primarily observed among patients younger than 65 years and not in older patients (P for interaction by age = 0.042). Body mass index was not associated with admission levels of biomarkers of inflammation, cardiac injury, or fibrinolysis. LIMITATIONS: Body mass index was missing for 28% of patients. The primary analyses were conducted with multiple imputation for missing BMI. Upper bounding factor analysis suggested that the results are robust to possible selection bias. CONCLUSION: Obesity is associated with increased risk for intubation or death from COVID-19 in adults younger than 65 years, but not in adults aged 65 years or older.

AB  - The prevalence of obesity is rising worldwide. Adipose tissue exerts anatomic and physiological effects with significant implications for critical illness. Changes in respiratory mechanics cause expiratory flow limitation, atelectasis, and VÃá/QÃá mismatch with resultant hypoxemia. Altered work of breathing and obesity hypoventilation syndrome may cause hypercapnia. Challenging mask ventilation and peri-intubation hypoxemia may complicate intubation. Patients with obesity are at increased risk of ARDS and should receive lung-protective ventilation based on predicted body weight. Increased positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), coupled with appropriate patient positioning, may overcome the alveolar decruitment and intrinsic PEEP caused by elevated baseline pleural pressure; however, evidence is insufficient regarding the impact of high PEEP strategies on outcomes. Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be safely performed in patients with obesity. Fluid management should account for increased prevalence of chronic heart and kidney disease, expanded blood volume, and elevated acute kidney injury risk. Medication pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics may be altered by hydrophobic drug distribution to adipose depots and comorbid liver or kidney disease. Obesity is associated with increased risk of VTE and infection; appropriate dosing of prophylactic anticoagulation and early removal of indwelling catheters may decrease these risks. Obesity is associated with improved critical illness survival in some studies. It is unclear whether this reflects a protective effect or limitations inherent to observational research. Obesity is associated with increased risk of intubation and death in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ongoing molecular studies of adipose tissue may deepen our understanding of how obesity impacts critical illness pathophysiology.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged in December 2019 and rapidly outspread worldwide endangering human health. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests itself through a wide spectrum of symptoms that can evolve to severe presentations as pneumonia and several non-respiratory complications. Increased susceptibility to COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality have been linked to associated comorbidities as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and, recently, to obesity. Similarly, individuals living with obesity are at greater risk to develop clinical complications and to have poor prognosis in severe influenza pneumonia. Immune and metabolic dysfunctions associated with the increased susceptibility to influenza infection are linked to obesity-associated low-grade inflammation, compromised immune and endocrine systems, and to high cardiovascular risk. These preexisting conditions may favor virological persistence, amplify immunopathological responses and worsen hemodynamic instability in severe COVID-19 as well. In this review we highlight the main factors and the current state of the art on obesity as risk factor for influenza and COVID-19 hospitalization, severe respiratory manifestations, extrapulmonary complications and even death. Finally, immunoregulatory mechanisms of severe influenza pneumonia in individuals with obesity are addressed as likely factors involved in COVID-19 pathophysiology.

AB  - Changes in school meal programs can affect well-being of millions of American children. Since 2014, high-poverty schools and districts nationwide had an option to provide universal free meals (UFM) through the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP). The COVID-19 pandemic expanded UFM to all schools in 2020-2022. Using nationally representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study: Kindergarten Class of 2010-2011, we measured CEP effects on school meal participation, attendance, academic achievement, children's body weight, and household food security. To provide plausibly causal estimates, we leveraged the exogenous variation in the timing of CEP implementation across states and estimated a difference-in-difference model with child random effects, school and year fixed effects. On average, CEP participation increased the probability of children's eating free school lunch by 9.3% and daily school attendance by 0.24 percentage points (p < 0.01). We find no evidence that, overall, CEP affected body weight, test scores and household food security among elementary schoolchildren. However, CEP benefited children in low-income families by decreasing the probability of being overweight by 3.1% (p < 0.05) and improving reading scores of Hispanic children by 0.055 standard deviations. UFM expansion can particularly benefit at-risk children and help improve equity in educational and health outcomes.

AB  - Previous studies showed that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown imposed changes in adults' lifestyle behaviors; however, there is limited information regarding the effects on youth. The COV-EAT study aimed to report changes in children's and adolescents' lifestyle habits during the first COVID-19 lockdown and explore potential associations between changes of participants' lifestyle behaviors and body weight. An online survey among 397 children/adolescents and their parents across 63 municipalities in Greece was conducted in April-May 2020. Parents self-reported changes of their children's lifestyle habits and body weight, as well as sociodemographic data of their family. The present study shows that during the lockdown, children's/adolescents' sleep duration and screen time increased, while their physical activity decreased. Their consumption of fruits and fresh fruit juices, vegetables, dairy products, pasta, sweets, total snacks, and breakfast increased, while fast-food consumption decreased. Body weight increased in 35% of children/adolescents. A multiple regression analysis showed that the body weight increase was associated with increased consumption of breakfast, salty snacks, and total snacks and with decreased physical activity. The COV-EAT study revealed changes in children's and adolescents' lifestyle behaviors during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Greece. Effective strategies are needed to prevent excessive body weight gain in future COVID-19 lockdowns.

AB  - Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on communities of racial/ethnic minority groups in the US where long-standing health issues and structural inequities are now known to have resulted in increased risk for infection, severe illness, and death from the virus. The objective of our study was to describe demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, medical interventions and outcomes of pediatric patients with COVID-19 treated at Children's Hospital of Michigan (CHM), a tertiary care center in urban Detroit, an early hotspot during the initial surge of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods. A retrospective chart review was performed of children ‚â§18‚Äâyears of age who had polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing via NP swab or serum IgG antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 during March 1, 2020-June 30, 2020. Results. Seventy-eight COVID-19 infected children were identified of whom 85.8% (67/78) were from minority populations (African American, Hispanic). Hospitalization rate was 82% (64/78). About 44% (34/78) had an associated comorbidity with asthma and obesity being most common. Although all ages were affected, infants <1‚Äâyear of age had the highest hospitalization rate (19/64, 30%). In all disease severity categories, dichotomized non-whites had more severe disease by percentage within race/ethnicity than Whites, and also within percent disease severity (P-value‚Äâ=‚Äâ.197). Overall, 37% of hospitalized patients required intensive care. Conclusions. Extremely high rates of COVID-19 hospitalization and requirement of ICU care were identified in our patient population. Further studies are needed to better understand the contributing factors to this health disparity in disadvantaged communities.

AB  - The first cases of unexplained pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019. Later, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causal agent of pneumonia. This virus has since spread to more than 180 countries and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Herein, we aimed to determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of symptomatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the relationship between the influenza vaccine with a lower risk of severe COVID-19 infection in the state of Sinaloa. We collected demographic and clinical data of 4,040 patients with acute respiratory infections across Sinaloa state hospitals from February 28 to May 15, 2020. The prevalence of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients with respiratory symptoms in Sinaloa showed 45.2% of men were more affected than women (p < 0.001), and people aged 40-49 years were the most affected. The main symptoms of COVID-19 infection were cough and fever (p < 0.001), while hypertension, obesity, and type 2 diabetes were the chronic diseases associated with COVID-19 than non-COVID-19 (p < 0.003). Healthcare workers were most likely to be infected compared to other occupations (p < 0.001). The general lethality rate was 14.1%, and males >62 years were the ones who had a higher lethality rate (p < 0.001); the aforementioned chronic diseases were related to higher lethality of COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Likewise, higher lethality was seen in housewives and patient retirees/pensioners compared with other occupations (p < 0.001). Finally, we found there was a relationship between influenza vaccination and a lower risk of severe COVID-19 infection and mortality (p < 0.001). These findings showed that healthcare workers, men >62 years with chronic diseases, and retired people were most affected. Furthermore, the influenza vaccine could decrease the severeness of COVID-19 cases.

AB  - The worldwide treatment gap for migraine before COVID-19 inevitably widens as attention focuses on an international emergency. Migraine hits people particularly in their early and middle years, potentially reduces quality of life and productivity, and remains a common emergency presentation. This article examines the impact of COVID-19 on migraine, and changing aspects of migraine care during and after the pandemic. Many risk factors for severe COVID-19-older age, male gender, cardiac and respiratory diseases, diabetes, obesity, and immunosuppression-are less frequent in migraineurs. Telemedicine is effective for migraine follow-up, and needs ongoing evaluation. Most migraine treatments can start or continue in acute COVID-19, with care to avoid drug interactions. Close contact procedures (botulinum toxin, acupuncture and steroid injections) are avoided in lockdown or in the vulnerable. Secondary effects of COVID-19, including long COVID and its economic impact, are probably equal or greater in people with migraine. Migraine and other long-term conditions need adequate resourcing to prevent personal, social and economic suffering. Treating migraine, a sequel of COVID, potentially reduces the impact of long COVID.

AB  - Aging is the primary risk factor for functional decline; thus, understanding and preventing disability among older adults has emerged as an important public health challenge of the 21st century. The science of gerontology - or geroscience - has the practical purpose of "adding life to the years." The overall goal of geroscience is to increase healthspan, which refers to extending the portion of the lifespan in which the individual experiences enjoyment, satisfaction, and wellness. An important facet of this goal is preserving mobility, defined as the ability to move independently. Despite this clear purpose, this has proven to be a challenging endeavor as mobility and function in later life are influenced by a complex interaction of factors across multiple domains. Moreover, findings over the past decade have highlighted the complexity of walking and how targeting multiple systems, including the brain and sensory organs, as well as the environment in which a person lives, can have a dramatic effect on an older person's mobility and function. For these reasons, behavioral interventions that incorporate complex walking tasks and other activities of daily living appear to be especially helpful for improving mobility function. Other pharmaceutical interventions, such as oxytocin, and complementary and alternative interventions, such as massage therapy, may enhance physical function both through direct effects on biological mechanisms related to mobility, as well as indirectly through modulation of cognitive and socioemotional processes. Thus, the purpose of the present review is to describe evolving interventional approaches to enhance mobility and maintain healthspan in the growing population of older adults in the United States and countries throughout the world. Such interventions are likely to be greatly assisted by technological advances and the widespread adoption of virtual communications during and after the COVID-19 era.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccines show excellent efficacy in clinical trials and effectiveness in real-world data, but some people still become infected with SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination. This study aimed to identify risk factors for post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe the characteristics of post-vaccination illness. METHODS: This prospective, community-based, nested, case-control study used self-reported data (eg, on demographics, geographical location, health risk factors, and COVID-19 test results, symptoms, and vaccinations) from UK-based, adult (‚â•18 years) users of the COVID Symptom Study mobile phone app. For the risk factor analysis, cases had received a first or second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine between Dec 8, 2020, and July 4, 2021; had either a positive COVID-19 test at least 14 days after their first vaccination (but before their second; cases 1) or a positive test at least 7 days after their second vaccination (cases 2); and had no positive test before vaccination. Two control groups were selected (who also had not tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before vaccination): users reporting a negative test at least 14 days after their first vaccination but before their second (controls 1) and users reporting a negative test at least 7 days after their second vaccination (controls 2). Controls 1 and controls 2 were matched (1:1) with cases 1 and cases 2, respectively, by the date of the post-vaccination test, health-care worker status, and sex. In the disease profile analysis, we sub-selected participants from cases 1 and cases 2 who had used the app for at least 14 consecutive days after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 3 and cases 4, respectively). Controls 3 and controls 4 were unvaccinated participants reporting a positive SARS-CoV-2 test who had used the app for at least 14 consecutive days after the test, and were matched (1:1) with cases 3 and 4, respectively, by the date of the positive test, health-care worker status, sex, body-mass index (BMI), and age. We used univariate logistic regression models (adjusted for age, BMI, and sex) to analyse the associations between risk factors and post-vaccination infection, and the associations of individual symptoms, overall disease duration, and disease severity with vaccination status. FINDINGS: Between Dec 8, 2020, and July 4, 2021, 1‚Äâ240‚Äâ009 COVID Symptom Study app users reported a first vaccine dose, of whom 6030 (0¬∑5%) subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 1), and 971‚Äâ504 reported a second dose, of whom 2370 (0¬∑2%) subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 2). In the risk factor analysis, frailty was associated with post-vaccination infection in older adults (‚â•60 years) after their first vaccine dose (odds ratio [OR] 1¬∑93, 95% CI 1¬∑50-2¬∑48; p<0¬∑0001), and individuals living in highly deprived areas had increased odds of post-vaccination infection following their first vaccine dose (OR 1¬∑11, 95% CI 1¬∑01-1¬∑23; p=0¬∑039). Individuals without obesity (BMI <30 kg/m(2)) had lower odds of infection following their first vaccine dose (OR 0¬∑84, 95% CI 0¬∑75-0¬∑94; p=0¬∑0030). For the disease profile analysis, 3825 users from cases 1 were included in cases 3 and 906 users from cases 2 were included in cases 4. Vaccination (compared with no vaccination) was associated with reduced odds of hospitalisation or having more than five symptoms in the first week of illness following the first or second dose, and long-duration (‚â•28 days) symptoms following the second dose. Almost all symptoms were reported less frequently in infected vaccinated individuals than in infected unvaccinated individuals, and vaccinated participants were more likely to be completely asymptomatic, especially if they were 60 years or older. INTERPRETATION: To minimise SARS-CoV-2 infection, at-risk populations must be targeted in efforts to boost vaccine effectiveness and infection control measures. Our findings might support caution around relaxing physical distancing and other personal protective measures in the post-vaccination era, particularly around frail older adults and individuals living in more deprived areas, even if these individuals are vaccinated, and might have implications for strategies such as booster vaccinations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study in a large tertiary maternity unit within a university hospital with an average annual birth of over 10,000 births. We prospectively collected and analysed data for a cohort of 23 pregnant patients including singleton and multiple pregnancies tested positive for COVID-19 between February 2020 and April 2020 inclusive to assess the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy, and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-three pregnant patients tested positive for COVID-19, delivering 20 babies including a set of twins, with four ongoing pregnancies at the time of manuscript submission. 16/23 (70 %) whom tested positive were patients from Asian (Indian sub-continent) background. The severity of the symptoms ranged from mild in 13/23 (65.2 %) of the patients, moderate in 2/23 (8.7 %), and severe in 8/23 (34.8 %). Four out of total 23 COVID-19 pregnant patients (17.4 %) developed severe adult respiratory distress syndrome complications requiring ICU support, one of whom led to maternal death 1/23 (4.3 %). 11/23 (48 %) of the patients had pre-existing co-morbidities, with morbid obesity 5/23 (21.7 %) and diabetes 4/23 (17.4 %) being the more commonly represented. Of the 23 pregnant patients 19 were in their third trimester of pregnancy and delivered; 7/19 (36.8 %) had preterm birth, 3/19 (15.8 %) developed adult respiratory distress syndrome before delivery, and 2/19 (10.5 %) had pre-eclampsia. 16/19 (84 %) of patients delivered by C-section. Out of the 20 new-borns, 18 were singletons with a set of twin. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with high prevalence of preterm birth, preeclampsia, and caesarean section compared to non-COVID pregnancies. COVID-19 infection was not found in the newborns and none developed severe neonatal complications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes within different ethnic groups of a cohort of hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. To quantify and describe the impact of a number of prognostic factors, including frailty and inflammatory markers. SETTING: Five acute National Health Service Hospitals in east London. DESIGN: Prospectively defined observational study using registry data. PARTICIPANTS: 1737 patients aged 16 years or over admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 1 January and 13 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from time of first hospital admission with COVID-19 diagnosis during or prior to admission. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU and hospital length of stay and type and duration of organ support. Multivariable survival analyses were adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: 1737 were included in our analysis of whom 511 had died by day 30 (29%). 538 (31%) were from Asian, 340 (20%) black and 707 (40%) white backgrounds. Compared with white patients, those from minority ethnic backgrounds were younger, with differing comorbidity profiles and less frailty. Asian and black patients were more likely to be admitted to ICU and to receive invasive ventilation (OR 1.54, (95% CI 1.06 to 2.23); p=0.023 and OR 1.80 (95% CI 1.20 to 2.71); p=0.005, respectively). After adjustment for age and sex, patients from Asian (HR 1.49 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.86); p<0.001) and black (HR 1.30 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.65); p=0.036) backgrounds were more likely to die. These findings persisted across a range of risk factor-adjusted analyses accounting for major comorbidities, obesity, smoking, frailty and ABO blood group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients from Asian and black backgrounds had higher mortality from COVID-19 infection despite controlling for all previously identified confounders and frailty. Higher rates of invasive ventilation indicate greater acute disease severity. Our analyses suggest that patients of Asian and black backgrounds suffered disproportionate rates of premature death from COVID-19.

AB  - Since the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China, much attention has focused on people with diabetes because of poor prognosis in those with the infection. Initial reports were mainly on people with type 2 diabetes, although recent surveys have shown that individuals with type 1 diabetes are also at risk of severe COVID-19. The reason for worse prognosis in people with diabetes is likely to be multifactorial, thus reflecting the syndromic nature of diabetes. Age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease, obesity, and a pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulative state all probably contribute to the risk of worse outcomes. Glucose-lowering agents and anti-viral treatments can modulate the risk, but limitations to their use and potential interactions with COVID-19 treatments should be carefully assessed. Finally, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection itself might represent a worsening factor for people with diabetes, as it can precipitate acute metabolic complications through direct negative effects on Œ≤-cell function. These effects on Œ≤-cell function might also cause diabetic ketoacidosis in individuals with diabetes, hyperglycaemia at hospital admission in individuals with unknown history of diabetes, and potentially new-onset diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Executive functions (EF) support engagement in goal-directed behaviors, including several health behaviors. Stressful and cognitively demanding events can disrupt EFs and interfere with health behavior, possibly to a greater extent in those with preexisting EF deficits. This study examined the association between preexisting EF deficits and subsequent negative changes in eating patterns, physical activity, sedentariness, and alcohol/substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Participants were 374 young adults in a follow-up study of the longitudinal, multisite Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD). Preexisting EF deficits were assessed with the Barkley Deficits in Executive Function Scales-Short Form, and personally impactful negative changes in four health behaviors (physical activity, unhealthy eating, sedentary time, alcohol/substance use) during the COVID-19 pandemic were subsequently assessed with the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory. RESULTS: In ordered logistic regression models, higher preexisting total EF deficits were associated with greater negative impactful changes in physical activity and unhealthy eating, independent of sociodemographic variables, obesity, and (as relevant) accelerometer-based physical activity and pre-COVID-19 diet quality. Socioeconomic status moderated the association between total EF deficits and impactful change in alcohol/substance use, with EF deficits linked to greater impactful change in alcohol/substance use only in higher socioeconomic strata. CONCLUSION: Individuals with preexisting EF deficits appear more vulnerable to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on several key health behaviors. As the pandemic unfolds, strategies may be needed to identify those with EF deficits (e.g., screening tools) and provide them with tailored support for chronic disease risk reduction.

AB  - The objective of this study was to identify the health conditions considered potential risk factors for severe Covid-19 and analyze its association with the BMI of elderly people living in Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCF). This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study, with a quantitative approach, carried out in eight LTCF in the Metropolitan Region of Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, with a population of 267 elderly people, between the months of February and December 2018. The Elderly Health Handbook was used to collect data on sociodemographic, health and risk factors. The Pearson's Chi-square test and odds ratio were used for the analysis. A higher frequency of low weight was observed in elderly people with cognitive impairment (24.6%), and overweight in those hypertensive (23.3%) and diabetics (12.9%). BMI was associated with the age group of 80 years or over, hypertension and diabetes (p = 0.013; p < 0.001; p = 0.001). Hypertensive elderly people were more likely to have low weight when compared to non-hypertensive individuals (RC = 3.6; 95% CI 1.5-8.6). The institutionalized elderly individuals present health conditions that may contribute to the occurrence of adverse outcomes in case of infection by Covid-19. The importance of protective measures for this population must be reinforced, in view of the devastating action of this disease in these institutions.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a declared global pandemic with multiple risk factors. Based on recent empirical studies, obesity is considered by several researchers as one of the serious risk factors for coronavirus-related complications. Yet, other scholars argue in favor of the existence of an obesity survival paradox. The objective of the current study is to analyze the potential relationships between different corona indicators and obesity on a statewide level. Since the United States is ranked as one of the OECD countries with a high level of overweight and obesity among its citizens‚Äîthe majority of US states exceed the 30% benchmark of obese population‚Äîit is an especially interesting case study to explore this issue. In an attempt to estimate projected probabilities for infection by coronavirus and mortality rates as a function of obesity prevalence, the fractional logit regression is employed. Findings may support the counter-intuitive possibility of an obesity survival paradox. Consequently, ethical guidelines referring to priority in intubation and intensive care treatments should account for these complex relationships between obesity and corona. Both projected rates of infection and mortality drop with elevated prevalence of obesity. The reasons for these findings might be explained by several conditions such as elevated social distancing from more obese persons, increased metabolic reserves, more aggressive treatment, and unidentified factors that should be examined in future research.

AB  - We continue to increase our cognizance and recognition of the importance of healthy living (HL) behaviors and HL medicine (HLM) to prevent and treat chronic disease. The continually unfolding events precipitated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have further highlighted the importance of HL behaviors, as indicated by the characteristics of those who have been hospitalized and died from this viral infection. There has already been recognition that leading a healthy lifestyle, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, may have a substantial protective effect in those who become infected with the virus. Now more than ever, HL behaviors and HLM are essential and must be promoted with a renewed vigor across the globe. In response to the rapidly evolving world since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the clear need to change lifestyle behaviors to promote human resilience and quality of life, the HL for Pandemic Event Protection (HL-PIVOT) network was established. The 4 major areas of focus for the network are: (1) knowledge discovery and dissemination; (2) education; (3) policy; (4) implementation. This HL-PIVOT network position statement provides a current synopsis of the major focus areas of the network, including leading research in the field of HL behaviors and HLM, examples of best practices in education, policy, and implementation, and recommendations for the future.

PARTICIPANTS: The first 1000 consecutive patients with a positive result on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who presented to the emergency department or were admitted to hospital between 1 March and 5 April 2020. Patient data were manually abstracted from electronic medical records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Characterization of patients, including demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities on presentation, hospital course, time to intubation, complications, mortality, and disposition. RESULTS: Of the first 1000 patients, 150 presented to the emergency department, 614 were admitted to hospital (not intensive care units), and 236 were admitted or transferred to intensive care units. The most common presenting symptoms were cough (732/1000), fever (728/1000), and dyspnea (631/1000). Patients in hospital, particularly those treated in intensive care units, often had baseline comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Patients admitted to intensive care units were older, predominantly male (158/236, 66.9%), and had long lengths of stay (median 23 days, interquartile range 12-32 days); 78.0% (184/236) developed acute kidney injury and 35.2% (83/236) needed dialysis. Only 4.4% (6/136) of patients who required mechanical ventilation were first intubated more than 14 days after symptom onset. Time to intubation from symptom onset had a bimodal distribution, with modes at three to four days, and at nine days. As of 30 April, 90 patients remained in hospital and 211 had died in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 at this medical center faced major morbidity and mortality, with high rates of acute kidney injury and inpatient dialysis, prolonged intubations, and a bimodal distribution of time to intubation from symptom onset.

RESULTS: Among the first 1000 patients, 150 were ED patients, 614 were admitted without requiring ICU-level care, and 236 were admitted or transferred to the ICU. The most common presenting symptoms were cough (73.2%), fever (72.8%), and dyspnea (63.1%). Hospitalized patients, and ICU patients in particular, most commonly had baseline comorbidities including of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. ICU patients were older, predominantly male (66.9%), and long lengths of stay (median 23 days; IQR 12 to 32 days); 78.0% developed AKI and 35.2% required dialysis.

Time to intubation from symptom onset had a bimodal distribution, with modes at 3-4 and 9 days. As of April 30, 90 patients remained hospitalized and 211 had died in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness at this medical center faced significant morbidity and mortality, with high rates of AKI, dialysis, and a bimodal distribution in time to intubation from symptom onset.

AB  - PURPOSE: Behaviour change techniques are fundamental to the development of any behaviour change intervention, but surprisingly little is known about their properties. Key questions include when, why, how, in which contexts, for which behaviours, in what combinations, compared with what, and for whom behaviour change techniques are typically effective. The aims of the present paper are to: (1) articulate the scope of the challenge in understanding the properties of behaviour change techniques, (2) propose means by which to tackle this problem, and (3) call scientists to action. METHODS: Iterative consensus (O'Connor et al., 2020, Br. J. Psychol., e12468) was used to elicit and distil the judgements of experts on how best to tackle the problem of understanding the nature and operation of behaviour change techniques. RESULTS: We propose a worldwide network of 'Centres for Understanding Behaviour Change' (CUBiC) simultaneously undertaking research to establish what are the single and combined properties of behaviour change techniques across multiple behaviours and populations. We additionally provide a first attempt to systematize an approach that CUBiC could use to understand behaviour change techniques and to begin to harness the efforts of researchers worldwide. CONCLUSION: Better understanding of behaviour change techniques is vital for improving behaviour change interventions to tackle global problems such as obesity and recovery from COVID-19. The CUBiC proposal is just one of many possible solutions to the problems that the world faces and is a call to action for scientists to work collaboratively to gain deeper understanding of the underpinnings of behaviour change interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective is to study the role, if any, of excess body weight in COVID-19 mortality. STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-country study of plausible associations between COVID-19 mortality and the proportion of overweight among adults, controlling for age, gender, and income. METHODS: Parametric and non-parametric regression analysis. RESULTS: We observe a statistically significant positive association between COVID-19 mortality and the proportion of the overweight in adult populations spanning 154 countries. This association holds across countries belonging to different income groups and is not sensitive to a population's median age, proportion of the elderly, and/or proportion of females. The estimated elasticities of COVID-19 mortality, with respect to the proportion of the overweight in adult populations, are consistently higher for sub-samples of countries that belong to a higher income group. On an average, every percentage point increment in the proportion of the overweight in adult populations contributes to an additional 3.5% points to COVID-19 mortality for high income countries: the limits of confidence intervals around this point estimate range between 1.5 and 5.4. CONCLUSIONS: A positive association between COVID-19 mortality and the proportion of the overweight in a country's adult population is robust, subject to alterations in the conditioning information set on age, gender, and income. Our findings call for an effective alignment of public policy regulations with public health priorities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an enormous and growing burden on the population and health infrastructure, warranting innovative ways to mitigate risk of contracting and developing severe forms of this disease. A growing body of literature raises the issue of vitamin C and vitamin D as a risk-assessment tool, and therapeutic option, in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this pilot study was to measure serum vitamin C and vitamin D levels in a cohort of patients with critical COVID-19 illness in our community hospital ICU, correlate with other illness risk factors (age, BMI, HgbA1c, smoking status), generate hypotheses, and suggest further therapeutic intervention studies. METHOD: This pilot study included all 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients hospitalized in May 2020 in the ICU of North Suburban Medical Center, Thornton, Colorado, in whose care the principal investigator (C.A.) was involved. We measured patients' serum vitamin C and vitamin D levels, and standard risk factors like age, BMI, HbA1c, and smoking status. Variables in this study were gauged using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients (15 males and 6 females, 17 Hispanic and 4 Caucasian, of median age 61 years, range 20-94), there were 11 survivors.Serum levels of vitamin C and vitamin D were low in most of our critically ill COVID-19 ICU patients.Older age and low vitamin C level appeared co-dependent risk factors for mortality from COVID-19 in our sample.Insulin resistance and obesity were prevalent in our small cohort, but smoking was not. CONCLUSION: Our pilot study found low serum levels of vitamin C and vitamin D in most of our critically ill COVID-19 ICU patients. Older age and low vitamin C level appeared co-dependent risk factors for mortality. Many were also insulin-resistant or diabetic, overweight or obese, known as independent risk factors for low vitamin C and vitamin D levels, and for COVID-19.These findings suggest the need to further explore whether caring for COVID-19 patients ought to routinely include measuring and correcting serum vitamin C and vitamin D levels, and whether treating critically ill COVID-19 warrants acute parenteral vitamin C and vitamin D replacement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Phytobezoar formation is a complication of bariatric surgery and mostly occurs after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) operations. Here, we present an extremely rare case of late phytobezoar formation following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old woman with a body mass index (BMI) of 40.7¬†kg/m(2) underwent LSG. Following persistent symptoms of nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and tremendous weight loss, endoscopy was performed, and gastric phytobezoar was detected at one-year post-operation. After endoscopic fragmentation, phytobezoar was removed by snare, and the patient later underwent redo bariatric surgery (conversion of LSG to LRYGB). CONCLUSIONS: With an increase in the number of LSG procedures performed globally, and the late-onset nature of phytobezoar formation, more cases of this complication are expected to be detected in future. Long-term postoperative follow-up alongside applying surgical methods to avoid gastric stenosis are needed to reduce the chance of phytobezoar formation in patients undergoing LSG.

AB  - As the city of Detroit raids itself of deaths by shifting from homicides, COVID-19 infection continues to harrow the city with more deaths. From March 19 to May 15, more Detroiters died in 2¬†months than were killed in 2¬†years of city homicides. African Americans or Blacks (highest-risk phenotypes) developing COVID-19 infection are more likely to die disproportionately. The confluence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and the higher prevalence of obesity among Blacks have provided the needed environment for viruses like COVID-19 to thrive and cause serious infections. The purpose of this study is to connect mortality rates from COVID-19 infection to increasing obesity trends among African Americans within the city of Detroit. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS ver. 23. Results showed that the highest mortality rates among African Americans occurred more in the obese individuals infected with COVID-19 in the city of Detroit. Out of 1930 deaths from COVID-19 infections, 733 deaths were due to obesity alone in patients without reported comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Mortality rate for both male and female African Americans amounted to a total of 11.9%. Thirty-eight percent of reported COVID-19-infected African Americans were obese.

AB  - According to several studies, obesity increases rates of metabolic syndrome plus other comorbidities like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. However, little evidence exists as to whether obesity assists in the prolongation of COVID-19 and seasonal flu-like symptoms especially among African American 55-74-year age groups. The purpose of this study is to show that COVID-19 symptoms can prolong recovery times and symptoms of seasonal flu-infected obese African Americans. The aim of the study is to investigate risk factors which include modifiable (i.e., obesity) and non-modifiable (i.e., age, race) effect on prolongation and recovery times for some inpatient COVID-19 and seasonal flu-infected African American from a single hospital in Detroit, MI.

AB  - Behavioral health has the opportunity to lead the way in using lifestyle interventions to address obesity and health disparities in people with serious mental illness (SMI) in the COVID-19 era. Evidence-based interventions for weight loss in individuals with SMI exist, and the field has developed strategies for implementing these interventions in real-world mental health care settings. In addition to promoting weight loss, lifestyle interventions have the potential to address social isolation and loneliness and other patient-centered outcomes among individuals with SMI, which will be especially valuable for mitigating the growing concerns about loneliness attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on in-person encounters. In this commentary, we discuss practice, policy, and research implications related to using evidence-based lifestyle interventions for individuals with SMI during the COVID-19 pandemic and sustaining these programs in the long-term.

AB  - The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented on physical and mental health. This study aimed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 event on mental health among Saudi Arabian females of Riyadh by a cross-sectional study design. The samples of the study were recruited using convenience and snowball sampling methods. The questionnaire is composed of items related to sociodemographic profile, general mental status, negative attitude scale, impact of event (COVID-19 pandemic) scale (R) and negative health impact. The data obtained were analyzed using multivariate regression analysis. Out of the 797 samples (34.58 ¬± 12.89 years), 457 (57.34%) belonged to an age group of ‚â•25 years. The average BMI of the participants was 26.73 (kg/m(2)). Significantly (p = 0.000), a large proportion of the participants were overweight and unemployed. Age group (>25 years) have more odds for abnormal mental status (OR; 1.592), development of negative attitudes (OR; 1.986), the intense impact of COVID-19 events (OR; 1.444) and susceptibility to attain negative health impacts (OR; 1.574). High body weight is another risk factor for altered mental status, negative attitude and developing impact of COVID-19 quickly. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic was directly associated with stress (53%), anxiety (63%) and depression (44%) in our sample population. There is an urgent need for psychological counseling for the distressed population.

AB  - This work aimed to study the effect of confinement on weight and lifestyle using the Wakamola chatbot to collect data from 739 adults divided into two groups (341 case-control, 398 confinement). Nutrition score (0-100 scale) improved for men (medians 81.77-82.29, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05), with no difference for women (medians 82.29 in both cases). Both genders reduced the consumption of sweetmeats and sugared drinks (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01); men increased their consumption of vegetables, salad, and legumes (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). Both genders reduced their physical activity score (men 100-40.14, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01, women 80.42-36.12, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). Women sat less hours/week, men's medians 28.81-28.27, women's medians 35.97-23.33, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.03. Both genders slept longer (hours/day), men 7-7.5, women 7-8 (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01) (medians). Their overall health score was significantly reduced (men 85.06-74.05, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01, women 84.47-72.42, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01), with no significant weight difference in either gender. Wakamola helped to contact participants and confirm changes in their lifestyle during confinement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Our clinical trial of a mobile exercise intervention for adults 18 to 65 years old with type 1 diabetes (T1D) occurred during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions, prompting us to test web-based recruitment methods previously underexplored for this demographic. OBJECTIVE: Our objectives for this study were to (1) evaluate the effectiveness and cost of using social media news feed advertisements, a clinic-based approach method, and web-based snowball sampling to reach inadequately active adults with T1D and (2) compare characteristics of enrollees against normative data. METHODS: Participants were recruited between November 2019 and August 2020. In method #1, Facebook and Instagram news feed advertisements ran for five 1-to-8-day windows targeting adults (18 to 64 years old) in the greater New Haven and Hartford, Connecticut, areas with one or more diabetes-related profile interest. If interested, participants completed a webform so that the research team could contact them for eligibility screening. In method #2, patients 18 to 24 years old with T1D were approached in person at clinical visits in November and December 2019. Those who were interested immediately completed eligibility screening. Older patients could not be approached due to clinic restrictions. In method #3, snowball sampling was conducted by physically active individuals with T1D contacting their peers on Facebook and via email for 48 days, with details to contact the research staff to express interest and complete eligibility screening. Other methods referred participants to the study similarly to snowball sampling. RESULTS: In method #1, advertisements were displayed to 11,738 unique viewers and attracted 274 clickers (2.33%); 20 participants from this group (7.3%) volunteered, of whom 8 (40%) were eligible. Costs averaged US $1.20 per click and US $95.88 per eligible volunteer. Men had lower click rates than women (1.71% vs 3.17%; P<.001), but their responsiveness and eligibility rates did not differ. In method #2, we approached 40 patients; 32 of these patients (80%) inquired about the study, of whom 20 (63%) volunteered, and 2 of these volunteers (10%) were eligible. Costs including personnel for in-person approaches averaged US $21.01 per inquirer and US $479.79 per eligible volunteer. In method #3, snowball sampling generated 13 inquirers; 12 of these inquirers (92%) volunteered, of whom 8 (67%) were eligible. Incremental costs to attract inquirers were negligible, and total costs averaged US $20.59 per eligible volunteer. Other methods yielded 7 inquirers; 5 of these inquirers (71%) volunteered, of whom 2 (40%) were eligible. Incremental costs to attract inquirers were negligible, and total costs averaged US $34.94 per eligible volunteer. Demographic overrepresentations emerged in the overall cohort (ie, optimal glycemic control, obesity, and low exercise), among those recruited by news feed advertisements (ie, obesity and older age), and among those recruited by snowball sampling (ie, optimal glycemic control and low exercise). CONCLUSIONS: Web-based advertising and recruitment strategies are a promising means to attract adults with T1D to clinical trials and exercise interventions, with costs comparing favorably to prior trials despite targeting an uncommon condition (ie, T1D) and commitment to an intervention. These strategies should be tailored in future studies to increase access to higher-risk participants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on patronage to unhealthy eating establishments in populations with obesity. METHODS: Anonymized movement data accounting for roughly 10% of devices in the United States at 138,989 unhealthy eating locations from December 1, 2019, through April 2020 and the percentage of adults with obesity, the poverty rate, and the food environment index in 65% of United States counties were collected and merged. A cluster corrected Poisson spline regression was performed predicting patronage by day, the percentage of adults with obesity in the establishment's county, the county's poverty rate, and its food environment index, as well as their interactions. RESULTS: Patronage to unhealthy eating establishments was higher where there was a higher percentage of the adult population with obesity. A similar pattern was observed for counties with a lower food environment index. These disparities appear to have increased as the COVID-19 pandemic spread. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest unhealthy eating patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic are higher in already at-risk populations. Policy makers can use these findings to motivate interventions and programs aimed at increasing healthy food intake in at-risk communities during crises.

AB  - Background : Latin America has now become the epicenter of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, a profound burden of SARS-COV-2 infection has been reported in Latin America. In the present study, we aim to determine the profiles that are associated with this disease in Latin America. We analyzed symptoms, morbidities and gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations by country. Methods: We analyzed data from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients evaluated at healthcare centers and hospitals of 8 Latin American countries including Brazil, Peru, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia between March 1 and July 30, 2020. These countries consist of a total population that exceeds 519 million. Demographics, comorbidities and clinical symptoms were collected. Statistical descriptive analysis and correlation analyses of symptoms, comorbidities and lethality were performed. Results: A total of 728,282 patients tested positive for COVID-19 across all the 8 Latin American countries. Of these, 52.6% were female. The average age was 48.4 years. Peru had the oldest cohort with 56.8 years old and highest rate of females (56.8%) while Chile had the youngest cohort (39 years old). Venezuela had the highest male prevalence (56.7%). Most common symptoms were cough with 60.1% (Bolivia had the highest rate 78%), fatigue/tiredness with 52.0%, sore throat with 50.3%, and fever with 44.2%. Bolivia had fever as the top symptom (83.3%). GI symptoms including diarrhea (highest in Mexico with 22.9%), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain were not associated with higher mortality. Hypertension was among the top (12.1%) comorbidities followed by diabetes with 8.3% and obesity 4.5%. In multivariable analyses, the leading and significant comorbidities were hypertension (r=0.83, p=0.02), diabetes (r=0.91, p=0.01), and obesity (r=0.86, p=0.03). Asthma (r=0.37, p=0.54) and increasing age (0.13 p=0.81) were not independently associated with higher mortality. Lethality was highest in Mexico (16.6%) and lowest in Venezuela (0.9%) among the analyzed cohorts. Conclusion: Nearly, 10.5%-53% of patients with COVID-19 have GI manifestations. Differential clinical symptoms were associated with COVID-19 in Latin America countries. Metabolic syndrome components were the main comorbidities associated with poor outcome. Country-specific management and prevention plans are needed. Country-specific management and prevention plans can be established from this meta-analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Well-controlled glucose levels (ie, 70-180 mg/dL) have been associated with lower mortality from COVID-19. The addition of dexamethasone to COVID-19 treatment protocols has raised concerns about the potential negative consequences of dexamethasone-induced hyperglycemia. METHODS: We developed a protocol to guide the management of dexamethasone-induced hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Two of the 4 medical teams managing patients with COVID-19 at a tertiary center in Saudi Arabia used the protocol and the other 2 teams continued to manage hyperglycemia at the discretion of the treating physicians (protocol and control groups, respectively). The glycemic control and clinical outcomes in 163 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and dexamethasone-induced hyperglycemia between July 5th and September 30th, 2020, were retrospectively compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the protocol group had higher proportions of patients with well-controlled glucose across all premeals and bedtime glucose readings throughout the hospital stay. The differences in glycemic control between the 2 groups were statistically significant for fasting glucose on days 4, 5, and the discharge day; prelunch glucose on the discharge day; predinner glucose on days 3, 5, and the discharge day; and bedtime glucose on day 1 (all P < .05). After adjusting for age, sex, nationality, body mass index, Charlson score, and diabetes status, patients in the protocol group were more likely to have well-controlled glucose levels compared with those in the control group. Moreover, the in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the protocol group (12.93%) compared to the control group (29.93%) (P < .01). CONCLUSION: The implementation of a protocol to manage dexamethasone-induced hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 resulted in more patients achieving well-controlled glucose levels and was associated with lower mortality from COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is increasing evidence of cardiovascular morbidity associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019). Pro-B-type natriuretic peptide is a biomarker of myocardial stress, associated with various respiratory and cardiac outcomes. We hypothesized that pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level would be associated with mortality and clinical outcomes in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients. DESIGN: We performed a retrospective analysis using adjusted logistic and linear regression to assess the association of admission pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (analyzed by both cutoff > 125 pg/mL and log transformed pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) with clinical outcomes. We additionally treated body mass index, a confounder of both pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels and coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes, as an ordinal variable. SETTING: We reviewed hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who had a pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level measured within 48 hours of admission between March 1, and August 31, 2020, from a multihospital U.S. health system. PATIENTS: Adult patients (‚â• 18 yr old; n = 1232) with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to the health system. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and troponin I level, higher pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level was significantly associated with death and secondary outcomes of new heart failure, length of stay, ICU duration, and need for ventilation among hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients. This significance persisted after adjustment for body mass index as an ordinal variable. The adjusted hazard ratio of death for log transformed pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was 1.56 (95% CI, 1.23-1.97; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Further investigation is warranted on the utility of pro-B-type natriuretic peptide for clinical prognostication in coronavirus disease 2019 as well as implications of abnormal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in the underlying pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019-related myocardial injury.

AB  - Hypoxemia is a hallmark of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. We sought to determine predictors of hypoxemia and related adverse outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the two largest hospitals in Jerusalem, Israel, from 9 March through 16 July 2020. Patients were categorized as those who developed reduced (<94%) vs. preserved (‚â•94%) arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) within the first 48 h after arrival to the emergency department. Overall, 492 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with reduced SpO(2) were significantly older, had more comorbidities, higher body surface area (BSA) and body mass index (BMI), lower lymphocyte counts, impaired renal function, and elevated liver enzymes, c-reactive protein (CRP), and D-dimer levels as compared to those with preserved SpO(2). In the multivariable regression analysis, older age (odds ratio (OR) 1.02 per year, p < 0.001), higher BSA (OR 1.16 per 0.10 m(2), p = 0.003) or BMI (OR 1.05 per 1 kg/m(2), p = 0.011), lower lymphocyte counts (OR 1.72 per 1 √ó 10(3)/ŒºL decrease, p = 0.002), and elevated CRP (1.11 per 1 mg/dL increase, p < 0.001) were found to be independent predictors of low SpO(2). Severe hypoxemia requiring ventilatory support, older age, and pre-existing comorbidities, including underlying renal dysfunction and heart failure, were found to be significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. These findings suggest that assessment of predictors of hypoxemia early at the time of hospitalization with COVID-19 may be helpful in risk stratification and management.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started as an epidemic in Wuhan in 2019, and has since become a pandemic. Groups from China identified and sequenced the virus responsible for COVID-19, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and determined that it was a novel coronavirus sharing high sequence identity with bat- and pangolin-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, suggesting a zoonotic origin. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a broad range of vertebrates. The rapid release of the sequence of the virus has enabled the development of diagnostic tools. Additionally, serological tests can now identify individuals who have been infected. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a fatality rate of around 1-3%, which is commonly linked to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely resulting from uncontrolled immune activation, the so called "cytokine storm". Risk factors for mortality include advanced age, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Drug repurposing has been used to rapidly identify potential treatments for COVID-19, which could move quickly to phase III. Better knowledge of the virus and its enzymes will aid the development of more potent and specific direct-acting antivirals. In the long term, a vaccine to prevent infection is crucial; however, even if successful, it might not be available before 2021-22. To date, except for intravenous remdesivir and dexamethasone, which have modest effects in moderate to severe COVID-19, no strong clinical evidence supports the efficacy of any other drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this review is to provide insights on the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, its virology, diagnostic tools, and the ongoing drug discovery effort.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is wreaking havoc on society. Bariatric patients are more prone to severe infection due to their high body mass index (BMI) and are more vulnerable to the effects of isolation, such as depression or disruption of their health habits. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the impact of self-quarantine on bariatric patients and self-quarantine's relationship with weight gain. SETTING: Academic hospital, United States. METHODS: A 30-item survey examining several known contributors to weight regain was distributed among the postoperative bariatric patients of our clinic. Changes in eating habits, exercise, depression, social support, loneliness, and anxiety were studied, among others. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients completed the survey (29.3% response rate). A large percentage of patients reported increases in their depression (44.2%), loneliness (36.2%), nervousness (54.7%), snacking (62.6%), loss of control when eating (48.2%), and binge eating (19.5%) and decreases in their social support (23.2%), healthy food eating (45.5%), and activity (55.2%). Difficulty in accessing vitamins was reported by 13%. Patients more than 18 months out of surgery regained more than 2 kg during an average of 47 days. Risk factors for weight regain were found to be loss of control when eating, increases in snacking and binge eating, reduced consumption of healthy food, and reduced physical activity. CONCLUSION: Bariatric patients are negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social isolation on many levels. This patient population is vulnerable to crisis situations; thus, additional intervention is needed to address behaviors that lead to weight regain.

AB  - Background: Most biomedical research has focused on sampling COVID-19 patients presenting to hospital with advanced disease, with less focus on the asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic. We established a bioresource with serial sampling of health care workers (HCWs) designed to obtain samples before and during mainly mild disease, with follow-up sampling to evaluate the quality and duration of immune memory. Methods: We conducted a prospective study on HCWs from three hospital sites in London, initially at a single centre (recruited just prior to first peak community transmission in London), but then extended to multiple sites 3 weeks later (recruitment still ongoing, target n=1,000). Asymptomatic participants attending work complete a health questionnaire, and provide a nasal swab (for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR tests) and blood samples (mononuclear cells, serum, plasma, RNA and DNA are biobanked) at 16 weekly study visits, and at 6 and 12 months. Results: Preliminary baseline results for the first 731 HCWs (400 single-centre, 331 multicentre extension) are presented. Mean age was 38¬±11 years; 67% are female, 31% nurses, 20% doctors, and 19% work in intensive care units. COVID-19-associated risk factors were: 37% black, Asian or minority ethnicities; 18% smokers; 13% obesity; 11% asthma; 7% hypertension and 2% diabetes mellitus. At baseline, 41% reported symptoms in the preceding 2 weeks. Preliminary test results from the initial cohort (n=400) are available: PCR at baseline for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 28 of 396 (7.1%, 95% CI 4.9-10.0%) and 15 of 385 (3.9%, 2.4-6.3%) had circulating IgG antibodies. Conclusions: This COVID-19 bioresource established just before the peak of infections in the UK will provide longitudinal assessments of incident infection and immune responses in HCWs through the natural time course of disease and convalescence. The samples and data from this bioresource are available to academic collaborators by application¬† https://covid-consortium.com/application-for-samples/.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional observational studies have reported obesity and cardiometabolic co-morbidities as important predictors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization. The causal impact of these risk factors is unknown at present. METHODS: We conducted multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the observational associations between obesity traits (body mass index [BMI], waist circumference [WC]), quantitative cardiometabolic parameters (systolic blood pressure [SBP], serum glucose, serum glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and triglycerides [TG]) and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the UK Biobank cohort. One-sample MR was performed by using the genetic risk scores of obesity and cardiometabolic traits constructed from independent datasets and the genotype and phenotype data from the UK Biobank. Two-sample MR was performed using the summary statistics from COVID-19 host genetics initiative. Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to assess the risk conferred by different genetic quintiles of causative exposure traits. RESULTS: The study comprised 1,211 European participants who were tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 387,079 participants who were either untested or tested negative between 16 March 2020 to 31 May 2020. Observationally, higher BMI, WC, HbA1c and lower HDL-cholesterol were associated with higher odds of COVID-19 infection. One-sample MR analyses found causal associations between higher genetically determined BMI and LDL cholesterol and increased risk of COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.15, confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.26 and OR: 1.58, CI: 1.21-2.06, per 1 standard deviation increment in BMI and LDL cholesterol respectively). Two-sample MR produced concordant results. Cox models indicated that individuals in the higher genetic risk score quintiles of BMI and LDL were more predisposed to COVID-19 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24, CI: 1.03-1.49 and HR: 1.37, CI: 1.14-1.65, for the top vs the bottom quintile for BMI and LDL cholesterol, respectively). CONCLUSION: We identified causal associations between BMI, LDL cholesterol and susceptibility to COVID-19. In particular, individuals in higher genetic risk categories were predisposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings support the integration of BMI into the risk assessment of COVID-19 and allude to a potential role of lipid modification in the prevention and treatment.

AB  - PURPOSE: COVID-19 pandemics and cardiometabolic health are mutually interconnected. Chronic metabolic diseases are known risk factors for increased mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In turn, COVID pandemics imposed sudden changes in lifestyle and social isolation with consequent potential cardiometabolic sequelae. The present study aimed at investigating the impact of changes in lifestyle and social life on metabolic profile in hyperprolactinemic or osteoporotic patients without pre-existing cardiometabolic diseases at the time of COVID-19. METHODS: The primary study outcome measurement was the prevalence of obesity, arterial hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome after COVID-19 outbreak. Seventy-four patients (21 men and 53 women, aged 51.8‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ17.8¬†years) were admitted to the outpatient clinic of the Neuroendocrine Disease Unit at University "Federico II" of Naples, Italy, as per their routine clinical practice because of tumoral and non-tumoral hyperprolactinemia in 52 patients (70.3%), and osteoporosis/osteopenia in 22 (29.7%). Among female patients, 25 (47.2%) were at menopausal age. RESULTS: At the end of lockdown, prevalence of obesity (from 37.8% to 51.3%, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001), dyslipidemia (from 28.4 to 48.6%, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.003) and metabolic syndrome (from 14.9 to 27%, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001) significantly increased compared to pre-COVID evaluation. No significant change was found in the prevalence of arterial hypertension and IGT/DM. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has led to a rapid increase in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, potentially contributing to the increased COVID-19 related mortality.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate whether use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a reduced likelihood of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the early weeks of the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted to determine selected treatment outcomes in 336 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at an acute care community hospital in the Hudson Valley region of New York from March 20 to April 20, 2020. Eligibility included admission to the hospital, a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and no need for intubation or intensive care at admission. The median (interquartile range) ages of patients who received hydroxychloroquine (n = 188) and those who did not (n = 148) were 68 (58-82) and 64 (51-73) years, respectively. In a multivariable model that included age, gender, obesity, diabetes, and hydroxychloroquine use, patients who received hydroxychloroquine were significantly more likely than those not treated with the drug to be transferred to an ICU (odds ratio, [OR], 8.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.8-17) and significantly more likely to be intubated (OR, 7.99; 95% CI, 3.76-16.91); these associations were not influenced by disease severity. In-hospital mortality did not differ significantly with disease severity between those who did and those who did not receive hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSION: Hydroxychloroquine use was significantly associated with increased risks of ICU admission and intubation in patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of COVID-19. There were no significant between-group differences in mortality with use vs nonuse of hydroxychloroquine.

AB  - The prevalence of obesity has more than doubled globally over the past few decades, with a 12-fold rise in extreme levels. Obesity, with its multiple complications, remains a major ongoing challenge for health-care professionals, as highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, where people with obesity had poorer outcomes. In this article, we review advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying obesity, with a focus on the immune system and its interaction with both the adipose tissue organ and the gut microbiome. As our understanding of the causes and effects of obesity improves, opportunities should emerge, underpinned by rigorous laboratory and clinical research, to both better prevent and treat this global epidemic.

AB  - Objectives With clinical experience from previous coronavirus infections, public health measures and fear of infection may have negative psychological effects on pregnant women. This study aimed to compare the level of anxiety and depression in the same pregnant women before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The pregnant women continuing pregnancy who participated in the first study which was undertaken to clarify the factors associated with mental health of pregnant women before the COVID-19 pandemic, were included for the current study during the outbreak. Anxiety and depression symptoms of the same pregnant women were evaluated by using the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms II and Beck Anxiety Inventory twice before and during the pandemic. Results A total of 63 pregnant women completed questionnaires. The mean age of the women and the mean gestational age was 30.35¬±5.27 years and 32.5¬±7¬†weeks, respectively. The mean total IDAS II score was found to increase from 184.78¬±49.67 (min: 109, max: 308) to 202.57¬±52.90 (min: 104, max: 329) before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. According to the BAI scores the number of patients without anxiety (from 10 to 6) and with mild anxiety (from 31 to 24) decreased and patients with moderate (from 20 to 25) and severe anxiety (from 2 to 8) increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that obesity and relationship with her husband are the best predictors of IDAS II scores. Conclusions This study indicated that COVID-19 outbreak affects the mental health of pregnant women negatively which leads to adverse birth outcomes. The level of anxiety and depression symptoms of pregnant women during the COVID-19 infection significantly increased. Healthcare professionals should establish comprehensive treatment plans for pregnant women who are highly vulnerable population to prevent mental trauma during the infectious disease outbreaks.

AB  - The aim of this review is to give a synopsis on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with major focus on the preventive measures. Ever since the influenza pandemic of 1918, and the second world war of (1939-1945), the world has not been faced with a common problem in recent memory like the COVID-19 pandemic. The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic is caused by infection with a viral pathogen, the nascent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and is characterized by respiratory failure in severe cases. The communicability period of COVID-19 varies, but it is usually between 2-14 days, and the major signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are high temperature (fever), severe and consistent cough, and serious breathing problems in severe cases, however, complications result in the serious inflammation of the lungs, and organ malfunction occurs in patients with comorbidities and health conditions especially diabetes, heart disease and obesity. With high virulence and contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2, over 11.4 million confirmed cases and over 533,780 deaths have occurred as a result of COVID-19 globally, with over 6.1 million recoveries as of 6(th) July 2020. Presently, there is no known cure for COVID-19, however, remdesivir has been approved for emergency use for the treatment of COVID-19 patients by the Food and Drug Administration, a United States federal regulatory body (FDA), while various clinical trial treatments and vaccines are being tried globally. The world is faced with containing the spread of the infection, and this review revealed that thorough hand washing with antiseptic soap and running water and usage of alcohol hand sanitizer, frequent surfaces cleaning, strict adherence to social distancing, regular respiratory hygiene, wearing of protective face masks, frequent testing, self-isolation, quarantine and rigorous contact tracing will help to prevent further spread, and control the transmission of the viral pathogen. It is however strongly recommended that only the strict compliance to the mitigative and preventive measures provided above will yield the desired results in the prevention, management and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel pandemic. Considerable differences in disease severity and the mortality rate have been observed in different parts of the world. The present study investigated the characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Iran. METHODS: We established a retrospective cohort to study hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Iran. Epidemiological, imaging, laboratory, and clinical characteristics and outcomes were recorded from medical documents. The chi-square test, t-test, and logistic regression models were used to analyze the data. A p<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: In total, 364 cases (207 males and 157 females) were analyzed. The most common symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnea. Multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacities with peripheral distribution were the predominant imaging finding. The mean age of patients was 54.28¬±18.81 years. The mean age of patients who died was 71.50¬±14.60 years. The mortality rate was 17.6%. The total proportion of patients with a comorbidity was 47.5%, and 84.4% of patients who died had a comorbidity. Sex, history of diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia were not significantly associated with mortality (p>0.05). However, mortality showed significant relationships with body mass index; age; history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), pulmonary disease, and cancer; and abnormal high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings (p<0.05 for all). Cancer had the highest odds ratio. CONCLUSION: Comorbidities (especially cancer, CKD, and CVA), severe obesity, old age, and abnormal HRCT findings affected the health outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

AB  - Background: Estimation of the basic reproduction number of an infectious disease is an important issue for controlling the infection. Here, we aimed to estimate the basic reproduction number (ùëÖ0) of COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: To estimate ùëÖ0 in Iran and Tehran, the capital, we used 3 different methods: exponential growth rate, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian time-dependent. Daily number of confirmed cases and serial intervals with a mean of 4.27 days and a standard deviation of 3.44 days with gamma distribution were used. Sensitivity analysis was performed to show the importance of generation time in estimating ùëÖ0. Results: The epidemic was in its exponential growth 11 days after the beginning of the epidemic (Feb 19, 2020) with doubling time of 1.74 (CI: 1.58-1.93) days in Iran and 1.83 (CI: 1.39-2.71) in Tehran. Nationwide, the value of ùëÖ0 from February 19 to 29 using exponential growth method, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian time-dependent methods was 4.70 (95% CI: 4.23-5.23), 3.90 (95% CI: 3.47- 4.36), and 3.23 (95% CI: 2.94-3.51), respectively. In addition, in Tehran, ùëÖ0 was 5.14 (95% CI: 4.15-6.37), 4.20 (95% CI: 3.38-5.14), and 3.94 (95% CI: 3.45-4.40) for exponential growth, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian time-dependent methods, respectively. Bayesian time dependent methods usually provide less biased estimates. The results of sensitivity analyses demonstrated that changes in the mean generation time affect estimates of ùëÖ0. Conclusion: The estimate of ùëÖ0 for the COVID-19 ranged from 3.94 to 5.14 in Tehran and from 3.23 to 4.70 in nationwide using different methods, which were significantly larger than 1, indicating the potential of COVID-19 to cause an outbreak.

AB  - PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is creating an unprecedented healthcare crisis. Understanding the determinants of mortality is crucial to optimise intensive care unit (ICU) resource use and to identify targets for improving survival. METHODS: In a multicentre retrospective study, we included 379 COVID-19 patients admitted to four ICUs between 20 February and 24 April 2020 and categorised according to time from disease onset to ICU admission. A Cox proportional-hazards model identified factors associated with 28-day mortality. RESULTS: Median age was 66¬†years (53-68) and 292 (77%) were men. The main comorbidities included obesity and overweight (67%), hypertension (49.6%) and diabetes (30.1%). Median time from disease onset (i.e., viral symptoms) to ICU admission was 8 (6-11) days (missing for three); 161 (42.5%) patients were admitted within a week of disease onset, 173 (45.6%) between 8 and 14¬†days, and 42 (11.1%)‚Äâ>‚Äâ14¬†days after disease onset; day 28 mortality was 26.4% (22-31) and decreased as time from disease onset to ICU admission increased, from 37 to 21% and 12%, respectively. Patients admitted within the first week had higher SOFA scores, more often had thrombocytopenia or acute kidney injury, had more limited radiographic involvement, and had significantly higher blood IL-6 levels. Age, COPD, immunocompromised status, time from disease onset, troponin concentration, and acute kidney injury were independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: The excess mortality in patients admitted within a week of disease onset reflected greater non-respiratory severity. Therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2 might impact different clinical endpoints according to time since disease onset.

AB  - Introduction: The preventive measures taken in attempt to prevent COVID-19 spread lead to closure of schools and leisure time activities. The impact of the pandemic on pediatric weight status is unclear, reports from around the world predict grave consequences with increasing obesity. We aimed to examine the change in body composition parameters of children and adolescents during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: An observational study of 220 pediatric subjects (109 boys; mean current age 11.8 ¬± 3.3 years; 37 with underweight, 123 with normal weight, and 60 with overweight/obesity) who underwent height and body composition measurements by bioelectrical impedance analysis, Tanita MC-780MA, GMON Professional Software before and during the pandemic. Height, body mass index (BMI) and muscle-to-fat ratio (MFR) z-scores were calculated. Data collected from the participants' medical files included home address for socioeconomic position calculation, pubertal stage, and self-reported sleep duration and physical activity performance. Results: The vast majority of the cohort (81.8%) had stable or improved MFR z-scores during the pandemic. MFR z-scores significantly increased in subjects with underweight (p = 0.05) and normal weight (p = 0.008), but not in subjects with overweight/obesity (p = 0.169). There were significant associations in BMI z-scores (r = 0.961, p < 0.001) and MFR z-scores (r = 0.854, p < 0.001) before and during the pandemic. A multivariate linear regression model identified socioeconomic position, pre-pandemic BMI z-scores, pre-pandemic MFR z-scores, and physical activity levels during the pandemic as predictors for delta MFR z-scores (F = 12.267, p < 0.001). Age, sex, pre-pandemic physical activity, and the time that had elapsed between initiation of the first nationwide lockdown and the BIA assessment during the pandemic did not emerge as predictors for delta MFR z-score. Conclusions: Our encouraging findings demonstrate improvement in body composition parameters of subjects with underweight and normal weight and stability in subjects with overweight/obesity. Engagement in physical activity during the pandemic predicted improvement, while lower socioeconomic position predicted deterioration.

AB  - As COVID-19 has been expanding rapidly around the world, the types of patients and their backgrounds vary. The substantially altered GI anatomy/physiology after bariatric surgery presents new challenges to the field of oral drug therapy. In this report we highlight issues for consideration when treating COVID-19 patients who previously underwent bariatric surgery and provide practical tools to allow optimal care of these patients. Post-bariatric absorption/pharmacokinetic changes may warrant dose adjustment, as well as the use of liquid oral dosage forms or parenteral routes of administration, if available. Realizing the potentially altered pharmacokinetics of various drugs after bariatric surgery is essential for providing optimal pharmacological therapy and overall patient care.

AB  - Unexpected isolation, which has not yet been seen on a global scale, has created the conditions for evaluating nutrition in a situation of reduced spatial activity. The study aimed to assess the influence of lockdown on selected eating habits of Polish adults. An anonymous questionnaire was conducted, including questions about eating habits and self-reported anthropometric measurements, referring to "before" and "during" lockdown. We reported the findings of 312 adults (aged 41.12 ¬± 13.05 years). Overall, 64.1% of the participants were women, 77.7% urban inhabitants and 78.6% employed. The average length of social isolation was 50.79 ¬± 10.53 days. The majority (51.6%) of the respondents did not eat outside the house during lockdown (p < 0.0001). The number of meals eaten during the day during lockdown increased significantly, 11.2% of the respondents ate 5 and more meals (p < 0.0001). The percentage of people snacking between meals increased by 5.1% during lockdown (p = 0.0001). Eggs, potatoes, sweets, canned meat and alcohol were consumed considerably more commonly during lockdown, while fast-food products, instant soups and energy drinks were eaten or drunk significantly less frequently. A marked decrease in the number of daily servings of the following products was observed: bakery products, red meat, fast food, instant soups, sweet beverages and energy drinks. Conversely, the number of daily servings of sweets and canned meat significantly increased. Two thirds of the respondents reported body weight changes, with 45.86% of the participants being overweight during lockdown. Significant changes in the diet of Polish adults were found during lockdown due to COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mississippi recorded the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on March 11, 2020. This report describes the initial COVID-19 experience of the single healthcare system serving Jackson County, Mississippi. The intent of this retrospective review of COVID-19 hospitalized patients was to identify any characteristics or interventions amenable to improving care management and clinical outcomes for patients within our community hospital. METHODS: All hospitalized patients 18 years of age and older in our health system with positive tests for COVID-19 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 [SARS CoV-2]) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction between March 15 and April 10, 2020 are included in this retrospective observational report. RESULTS: During the study period, 158 patients of the 1384 tested (11.4%) were positive for COVID-19 infection. Of the 158 patients, 41 (26%) were hospitalized, with 17 (41%) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The remaining 24 patients did not require ICU admission. The mean age of the 158 COVID-19-positive patients was 55 years (range 2-103). Obesity was noted in 68% of the hospitalized patients, including 13 (54%) of the non-ICU patients and 15 (88%) of the ICU patients. All 9 deceased patients were obese. Twelve of 17 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and 3 patients received only high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. Only 25% (3 of 12) of the IMV patients were successfully extubated during the study period. The median duration on IMV was 17 days (range 4-35). The mortality in the 158 COVID-19-positive patients was 5.7% (9 of 158). None of the 24 non-ICU patients died. The ICU mortality rate was 53% (9 of 17). CONCLUSIONS: This report describes a community hospital experience with COVID-19. Patient outcome was comparable to that reported at larger centers. Obesity was a major comorbidity and correlated with adverse outcomes. Amidst the initial wave of COVID-19 with high demand for inpatient treatment, it is reassuring that appropriate care can be provided in a community health system.

AB  - The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is associated with life-threatening severe illnesses and a mortality rate of approximately 35%, particularly in patients with underlying comorbidities. A systematic analysis of 637 MERS-CoV cases suggests that diabetes and hypertension are equally prevalent in approximately 50% of the patients. Cardiac diseases are present in 30% and obesity in 16% of the cases. These conditions down-regulate the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and impair the host's innate and humoral immune systems. In conclusion, protection against MERS-CoV and other respiratory infections can be improved if public health vaccination strategies are tailored to target persons with chronic disorders.

AB  - Over the past two decades a number of severe acute respiratory infection outbreaks such as the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have emerged and presented a considerable global public health threat. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that diabetic subjects are more susceptible to these conditions. However, the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 and MERS-CoV has not been systematically described. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of published reports documenting the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 and MERS-CoV and compare its frequency in the two viral conditions. Meta-analysis for the proportions of subjects with diabetes was carried out in 29 studies for H1N1 (n=92,948) and 9 for MERS-CoV (n=308). Average age of H1N1 patients (36.2¬±6.0 years) was significantly younger than that of subjects with MERS-CoV (54.3¬±7.4 years, P<0.05). Compared to MERS-CoV patients, subjects with H1N1 exhibited 3-fold lower frequency of cardiovascular diseases and 2- and 4-fold higher prevalence of obesity and immunosuppression, respectively. The overall prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 was 14.6% (95% CI: 12.3-17.0%; P<0.001), a 3.6-fold lower than in MERS-CoV (54.4%; 95% CI: 29.4-79.5; P<0.001). The prevalence of diabetes among H1N1 cases from Asia and North America was ~two-fold higher than those from South America and Europe. The prevalence of diabetes in MERS-CoV cases is higher than in H1N1. Regional comparisons suggest that an etiologic role of diabetes in MERS-CoV may exist distinctive from that in H1N1.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Large inter-individual and inter-population differences in the susceptibility to and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been noted. Understanding these differences and how they influence vulnerability to infection and disease severity is critical to public health intervention. AIM: To analyze and compare the profile of COVID-19 cases between China and North America as two regions that differ in many environmental, host and healthcare factors related to disease risk. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis to examine and compare demographic information, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, disease severity and levels of disease biomarkers of COVID-19 cases from clinical studies and data from China (105 studies) and North America (19 studies). RESULTS: COVID-19 patients from North America were older than their Chinese counterparts and with higher male: Female ratio. Fever, cough, fatigue and dyspnea were the most common clinical symptoms in both study regions (present in about 30% to 75% of the cases in both regions). Meta-analysis for the prevalence of comorbidities (such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and chronic kidney diseases) in COVID-19 patients were all significantly more prevalent in North America compared to China. Comorbidities were positively correlated with age but at a significantly younger age range in China compared to North American. The most prevalent infection outcome was acute respiratory distress syndrome which was 2-fold more frequent in North America than in China. Levels of C-reactive protein were 4.5-fold higher in the North American cases than in cases from China. CONCLUSION: The differences in the profile of COVID-19 cases from China and North America may relate to differences in environmental-, host- and healthcare-related factors between the two regions. Such inter-population differences-together with intra-population variability-underline the need to characterize the effect of health inequities and inequalities on public health response to COVID-19 and can assist in preparing for the re-emergence of the epidemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fatalities due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continue to increase, and information on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of deceased patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 is limited in the Arab region. The current study aimed to address this gap. METHODS: Three hundred and four Saudi patients in Jazan Region, Saudi Arabia, who died after being hospitalized with COVID-19 between July 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, were analyzed in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: A greater proportion of male patients (59%), compared to female patients (41%), died due to COVID-19. Just over half (55%) of the deaths due to COVID-19 affected patients aged ‚â•65 years. More than two-thirds of the deceased COVID-19 patients had diabetes (70%) and hypertension (69%); other comorbidities were obesity (30%), heart disease (30%), and chronic kidney disease (14%). Dyspnea (91%), cough (80%), and fever (70%) were the most frequently reported clinical symptoms. Eighty-five per cent of COVID-19 deaths occurred in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 90% of the patients required mechanical ventilation. Typically, lymphopenia, and neutrophilia were observed on admission and 24 hours prior to death. Creatinine and serum ferritin levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and D-dimer plasma levels increased significantly following infection with COVID-19. Lung infiltrates and pulmonary opacity (83%) were the most common findings on chest X-ray. Respiratory failure (70%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (52%) were the leading complications to death. Logistic and Cox regression revealed that a higher age, smoking, high creatinine and aspartate transaminase levels, and respiratory failure were significantly associated with the risk of mortality during the early stay in hospitals. CONCLUSION: The proportion of comorbidities was high in deceased patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 in Jazan region, Saudi Arabia. A higher age, smoking, and respiratory failure were significant predictors of mortality during the early stay in hospitals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess mortality risk associated with co-morbidities and blood group type in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This case-control study enrolled 323 Saudi adults with COVID-19, confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The participants were selected randomly between August 31, 2020, and July 1, 2020, from the Health Electronic Surveillance Network system, which contains the primary data on COVID-19 infections in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. The sample included 108 patients who died due to COVID-19 disease and 215 controls who recovered from it (1:2 ratio). The chi-square test, independent samples t-test, and logistic regression were used to perform the statistical analysis. RESULTS: Mortality was higher in older age patients with COVID-19 (mean = 65.4 years, standard deviation [SD] = 15.6) compared to recovered patients (mean = 39.5 years, SD = 14.8) (p<0.001) with a moderate effect size (eta squared = 0.06). Diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR] = 9.4), hypertension (OR = 8.6), cardiovascular disease (OR = 7.4), chronic kidney disease (OR = 3.3), and obesity (OR = 2.0) were significantly associated with death due to COVID-19. Using logistic regression analysis, older age and diabetes mellitus were the primary independent predictors of COVID-19 mortality. However, there was no significant association between a specific ABO blood group and mortality risk (P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Older age and the presence of co-morbidities, especially diabetes mellitus, increased the risk of death in patients with COVID-19. Establishing the causality of death in patients with COVID-19 should be a key aim of future studies.

AB  - Ensuring health and well-being during this pandemic is essential according to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Physical exercise has an important role in the preservation of the immune system, which is vital to prevent infections. To promote physical exercise and maintain a healthy status, recent studies have suggested general exercise routines to be implemented during the quarantine period. However, to improve the health-related physical fitness components, any specific prescription should include intensity, volume, duration, and mode. Controversy persists about which is the best intensity of physical activity, while performing exercise at a moderate intensity could bring important benefits to asymptomatic people. High intensity or unaccustomed exercise should be restricted for older people, and for people of all ages with chronic diseases or compromised immune system, obesity, or upper respiratory tract infection with limited symptoms. Besides, physical activity guidelines should be particular to each population group, giving special consideration to those vulnerable to COVID-19 who are much more likely to suffer more self-isolation. Therefore, the present study is to provide specific physical activity recommendations for different populations during this pandemic.

AB  - All of humans and other mammalian species are colonized by some types of microorganisms such as bacteria, archaea, unicellular eukaryotes like fungi and protozoa, multicellular eukaryotes like helminths, and viruses, which in whole are called microbiota. These microorganisms have multiple different types of interaction with each other. A plethora of evidence suggests that they can regulate immune and digestive systems and also play roles in various diseases, such as mental, cardiovascular, metabolic and some skin diseases. In addition, they take-part in some current health problems like diabetes mellitus, obesity, cancers and infections. Viral infection is one of the most common and problematic health care issues, particularly in recent years that pandemics like SARS and COVID-19 caused a lot of financial and physical damage to the world. There are plenty of articles investigating the interaction between microbiota and infectious diseases. We focused on stimulatory to suppressive effects of microbiota on viral infections, hoping to find a solution to overcome this current pandemic. Then we reviewed mechanistically the effects of both microbiota and probiotics on most of the viruses. But unlike previous studies which concentrated on intestinal microbiota and infection, our focus is on respiratory system's microbiota and respiratory viral infection, bearing in mind that respiratory system is a proper entry site and residence for viruses, and whereby infection, can lead to asymptomatic, mild, self-limiting, severe or even fatal infection. Finally, we overgeneralize the effects of microbiota on COVID-19 infection. In addition, we reviewed the articles about effects of the microbiota on coronaviruses and suggest some new therapeutic measures.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infective disease generated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Given the pandemic urgency and lack of an effective cure for this disease, drug repurposing could open the way for finding a solution. Lots of investigations are ongoing to test the compounds already identified as antivirals. On the other hand, induction of type I interferons are found to play an important role in the generation of immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it was opined that the antivirals capable of triggering the interferons and their signaling pathway, could rationally be beneficial for treating COVID-19. On this basis, using a database of antivirals, called drugvirus, some antiviral agents were derived, followed by searches on their relevance to interferon induction. The examined list included drugs from different categories such as antibiotics, immunosuppressants, anti-cancers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), calcium channel blocker compounds, and some others. The results as briefed here, could help in finding potential drug candidates for COVID-19 treatment. However, their advantages and risks should be taken into account through precise studies, considering a systemic approach. Even though the adverse effects of some of these drugs may overweight their benefits, considering their mechanisms and structures may give a clue for designing novel drugs in the future. Furthermore, the antiviral effect and IFN-modifying mechanisms possessed by some of these drugs might lead to a synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2, which deserve to be evaluated in further investigations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the impact of substance use disorder on the risk of hospitalization, complications, and mortality among adult patients diagnosed as having COVID-19. METHODS: The authors conducted a propensity score (PS)-matched double-cohort study (N=5,562 in each cohort) with data from the TriNetX Research Network database to identify 54,529 adult patients (‚â•18 years) diagnosed as having COVID-19 between February 20 and June 30, 2020. RESULTS: Primary analysis (PS matched on demographic characteristics and presence of diabetes and obesity) showed that substance use disorder was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (odds ratio [OR]=1.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.69-2.01), ventilator use (OR=1.45, 95% CI=1.22-1.72), and mortality (OR=1.30, 95% CI=1.08-1.56). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that COVID-19 patients with substance use disorders are at increased risk for adverse outcomes. The attenuation of ORs in the model that matched for chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases associated with substance abuse suggests that the observed risks may be partially mediated by these conditions.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the nationwide total lockdown (LD) in France on weight loss and body composition modifications in subjects participating in a weight loss program and to evaluate the impact of remote consultations on participants' adherence to the weight loss program. The CO-RNPC study was a prospective multicentre cohort study including participants undergoing a two to six months program. The rate of weight loss in kg/week was computed before (15 days), during (99 days) and after LD (15 days). In the 1550 completing participants, body weight decreased from 87.1 kg [IQR 77.0; 100.2] to 82.3 kg [72.1; 94.3] resulting in a difference of -4.79 kg [-4.48; -5.10] (p < 0.01), with a corresponding reduction in waist circumference by 4 cm ([0; 9], p < 0.01). The median weight loss was 4.4 kg [0.5; 9.4] in those who used remote consultations, and 1.4 kg [0.8; 5.7] in the no remote consultation group (p < 0.01). In this large prospective cohort, we observed that the rate of weight loss was reduced during LD. This reduction was counterbalanced in participants involved in a remote consultation follow-up with a dose-effect response based on the number of remote consultations.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the imposed lockdowns in order to control the pandemic, had undoubtedly influenced the lifestyle of millions of people worldwide. The period of confinement, which was characterized by seizing most business activities and allowing only for e-classes at schools and universities, leading also to a lower physical activity, could have affected eating behaviors of people of all ages. In this study we aimed to investigate the impact of the first lockdown period (March-May 2020) on body weight (BW) and on body mass index (BMI) in both adults and adolescents (>16 years old). A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed¬Æ, Scopus¬Æ, Web of Science¬Æ and EMBASE¬Æ databases and 36 observational (35 cross-sectional and one cohort) studies were included. BW and BMI changes after/during the lockdown period were examined. BW was stated as increased in a significant part of the individuals (11.1-72.4%), although a range of 7.2-51.4% of individuals reported weight loss. A significant higher BW was observed with a weighted mean between-group difference (WMD) 1.57 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.14) in the post-lockdown period compared to the before lockdown time and higher BMI, 0.31 WMD (95% CI, 0.17 to 0.45) was identified before the lockdown period. At variance with general trends, one study in older adults (>60 years old) notably reported a significant BW loss, suggesting a higher risk for lockdown-induced weight loss and potentially malnutrition in the elderly population. Overall increments in BW are an alarming effect of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to potential higher incidence of overweight, obesity and related health-risks as well as other noncommunicable diseases. Further studies are needed to assess potential group-specific impacts, with particular regard to weight gain in younger people and risk of weight loss, malnutrition and sarcopenia in older adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a new hyperinflammatory variant that evolved during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although the precise pathophysiology of MIS-C is uncertain, it is thought to be due to immune dysregulation occurring after recovery from acute infection. PURPOSE: Our study aimed to analyze the clinical spectrum, laboratory parameters, imaging characteristics, treatment strategies, and short-term outcomes of children with a diagnosis of MIS-C. METHODS: This retrospective and prospective observational study included children less than 16 years of age who were admitted to the pediatric unit of a tertiary care teaching hospital in south India between August 2020 to January 2021 with a diagnosis of MIS-C according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. RESULTS: Twenty-one children were included in the analysis; all had fever with variable combinations of other symptoms. The mean age was 6.9 years; 71.4% were male. Gastrointestinal (80.9%) and cardiovascular (80.9%) systems were the most commonly affected. The majority of children had elevated inflammatory markers, and 16 (76.2%) had echocardiographic abnormalities mimicking Kawasaki disease. Eleven (52.4%) children required intensive care admission, three (14.3%) required supplemental oxygen, and four (19%) required inotropes. Nine (42.9%)were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin alone, six (28.6%) with steroids alone, and three(14.3%) with steroids and immunoglobulin. The median hospital stay was 6 days; there were no fatalities. Overweight/obesity, elevated ferritin, and mucocutaneous involvement were significantly associated with a prolonged hospital stay (‚â•7 days). Sixteen (76.2%) children were followed up till now and all of them had no clinical concerns. CONCLUSION: MIS-C is an emerging disease with variable presentation. A high index of suspicion is necessary for its early identification and appropriate management. Further research is essential for developing optimal treatment strategies.

AB  - The city of Detroit has a large population of individuals with sickle cell disease, and hospitals in Detroit have seen some of the highest numbers of cases of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in 2020. The purpose of this study was to examine the pathophysiological characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with sickle cell disease or trait to determine whether these patients have unique manifestations that might require special consideration. This retrospective analysis included 24 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and sickle cell disease or trait who were seen at the Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI, USA, between March 1 and April 15 2020. Of the 24 patients, 18 (75.0%) had heterozygous sickle cell trait, one (4.0%) was a double heterozygote for Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T)/Œ≤(+)-thalassemia (Œ≤(+)-thal), four had sickle cell anemia (Œ≤(S)/Œ≤(S)) and one (4.0%) had Hb S/Hb C (HBB: c.19G>A) disease. A total of 13 (54.0%) patients required hospitalization. All four patients with sickle cell anemia, developed acute pain crisis. We observed one patient who developed acute pulmonary embolism and no patients developed other sickle cell associated complications. Additionally, three (13.0%) patients required packed red blood cell transfusion without the need of exchange transfusion, and one patient required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and subsequently died. Patients with sickle cell disease or trait and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 had a generally mild, or unremarkable, course of disease, with lower chances of intubation, ICU admission and death, but with a slightly longer hospitalization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in order to protect the patient and to save hospital beds, cancelation of elective surgeries has become a great challenge. Considering that obesity is a chronic disease and the possible effect imposed by quarantine on weight gain with worsening rates of obesity and metabolic comorbidities, the creation of a protocol for a safe return to bariatric surgery became essential. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of new-onset severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) symptoms in patients who underwent bariatric procedures during the declining curve period. SETTING: Private practice METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted and included patients with indications for bariatric surgery during the decreasing curve period of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic who underwent surgery under a hospital security protocol. Patients were asked to answer a questionnaire and had a swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The primary outcome measure was the presence of 14-day and 30-day postoperative symptoms associated with COVID-19. Mortality was also analyzed. RESULTS: Three hundred patients with negative RT-PCR were operated on from May to June 2020. Seventeen patients had their surgery postponed because of a positive RT-PCR test or close contact. None of the patients developed new-onset SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic infection after 30¬†days of observation. No deaths were reported. Eleven had complications not related to SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Even though this population may have a poorer outcome when infected with SARS-CoV-2, this security protocol has shown that the procedure can be safely performed during the outbreak.

AB  - Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The H-2 blocker famotidine has been suggested as an FDA-approved drug that could potentially be repurposed for treatment of COVID-19. Famotidine has since been shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce symptom severity in patients acutely ill with COVID-19. Other studies have suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) might have an association with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to determine whether famotidine or any other antireflux medications have a prophylactic or detrimental effect for SARS-CoV-2 infection when taken regularly for the management of acid reflux. METHODS: An anonymous, web-based survey was distributed via email to adult otolaryngology patients to collect demographic data, past medical history, medication history, incidence of symptoms associated with COVID-19, potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and results of any PCR or serological testing. Associations between reflux medications and incidence of COVID-19 cases were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Chi-square with Fisher's exact test, Point-Biserial correlation, Kendall's-tau-b, independent samples t test, and the Mann-Whitney U test were used as appropriate. A binary logistic regression model was fit to determine probability of COVID-19 cases after adjustment for other risk factors. RESULTS: There were 307 patients who responded to the survey. The average age of respondents was 52.63 ¬± 17.03. Famotidine use was not associated with incidence of laboratory-confirmed (P= 0.717) or symptomatically suspected (P= 0.876) COVID-19. No other reflux medications were found to be significant predictors for laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (P> 0.05). Younger age (odds ratio [OR]¬†=¬†1.043, 95% CI: 1.020-1.065, P< 0.001), high risk obesity (OR¬†=¬†4.005, 95% CI: 1.449-11.069, P= 0.007), and use of a corticosteroid nasal spray (OR¬†=¬†3.529, 95% CI: 1.352-9.211, P= 0.010) were significant predictors for symptomatically suspected COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: There was no association between incidence of COVID-19 and use of reflux medications, including famotidine at doses used orally to manage reflux and high dose PPIs. Reflux medications did not protect against or increase the risk of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID epidemic hit like a tsunami worldwide. At the time of its arrival in Italy, available literary data were meager, and most of them concerned its epidemiology. World Health Organization proposed guidelines in march 2020, a strategy of treatment has been developed, and a significant number of subsequent articles have been published to understand, prevent, and cure COVID patients. METHODS: From the observation of two patients, we performed a careful analysis of scientific literature to unearth the relation between COVID infection, clinical manifestations as pneumonia and thrombosis, and to find out why it frequently affects obese, diabetics, and elderly patients. RESULTS: The analysis shows that hepcidin could represent one of such correlating factors. Hepcidin is most elevated in older age, in non-insulin diabetics patients and in obese people. It is the final target therapy of many medicaments frequently used. Viral disease, and in particular SARS-CoV19, could induce activation of the hepcidin pathway, which in turn is responsible for an increase in the iron load. Excess of iron can lead to cell death by ferroptosis and release into the bloodstream, such as free iron, which in turn has toxic and pro-coagulative effects. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of hepcidin and iron overload might play a crucial role in COVID infection, becoming potential targets for treatment. Hepcidin could also be considered as a biomarker to measure the effectiveness of our treatments and the restoration of iron homeostasis the final intent. (www.actabiomedica.it).

AB  - Most people infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV2) are mildly symptomatic while few progress to critical illness and succumb to the infection. The disease severity is seen to be associated with increasing age and underlying comorbid conditions. Obesity, responsible for various metabolic disorders, appears to be a risk factor in determining the severity of infection despite any age group. Though this association is clinically relevant, the mechanisms underlying are not fully elucidated. SARS CoV2 enters host cell via Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 receptor, expression of which is upregulated in visceral fat tissue in obese people, underscoring the fact that adipose tissue is a potential reservoir for virus. Adipose tissue is also a source of many proinflammatory mediators and adipokines. High baseline C-Reactive Protein, interleukin 6, hyperleptinemia with Leptin resistance and hypoadiponectinemia associated with obesity explains the preexisting inflammatory state in obese individuals which predisposes them to worse outcomes and fatality.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pneumonia is both the most common type of lower respiratory tract infection and a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 raised an extremely serious concern, because its most frequent clinical presentation was pneumonia. Features such as sex play an active role in the incidence and outcomes of pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate differences between sexes concerning COVID-19-related pneumonia. METHODS: This was a retrospective, multicentre study that enrolled 340 consecutive adult patients admitted to hospital for COVID-19-related pneumonia. Of these patients, 219 were males (64.4%) and 121, females (35.6%). Primary endpoints were differences between both sexes as per clinical features, laboratory and radiologic results, and inhospital and 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included differences between both sexes and factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: Males admitted to the COVID-19 Unit were older than females (74.5 ¬± 15.7 vs. 64.5 ¬± 11.9). Cardiovascular disorders were more frequent in males (19.17% vs 13.25%), whereas obesity was more common in females (54.5% vs 37.45%). In-hospital and 30-day mortality were higher in males than in females (23.3% vs 15.7%; 24.6% vs 19.8%, respectively). No differences were observed in hospital stay; however, males had a longer ICU stay when compared with females (11.04¬±5.4 vs 7.05¬±3.4). Variables associated with a higher mortality rate included older age, a lower number of lymphocytes upon admission and higher levels of ferritin and troponin upon admission. CONCLUSIONS: Males had significantly higher mortality and longer ICU stay than females. More comorbidities in males than in females could explain the difference in mortality rates. The protective role of genetic factors can partially explain the better outcomes observed in female patients with COVID-19.

AB  - The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Individuals with metabolic syndrome are at increased risk for poor disease outcomes and mortality from COVID-19. The pathophysiologic mechanisms for these observations have not been fully elucidated. A critical interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) facilitates viral entry into the host cell. ACE2 is expressed in pancreatic islets, vascular endothelium, and adipose tissue, and the SARS-CoV-2 -ACE2 interaction in these tissues, along with other factors, governs the spectrum and the severity of clinical manifestations among COVID-19 patients with metabolic syndrome. Moreover, the pro-inflammatory milieu observed in patients with metabolic syndrome may contribute toward COVID-19-mediated host immune dysregulation, including suboptimal immune responses, hyperinflammation, microvascular dysfunction, and thrombosis. This review describes the spectrum of clinical features, the likely pathophysiologic mechanisms, and potential implications for the management of metabolic syndrome in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether COVID-19 comorbidities and risk factors such as old age, male gender, smoking, obesity, eosinophils and blood types have direct contact with expression of ACE2 and pro-inflammation cytokines in human lung tissues were still unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four patients with normal FEV(1) and FEV(1)/FVC underwent thoracotomy for pulmonary nodules were included. Blinded histological assessments were performed by two pathologists. Clinical features and results of the immunohistochemical staining of ACE2 were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: ACE2 expressed in alveolar macrophages (most obvious), alveolar epithelia and vascular endothelia, but not in small-airway epithelia. ACE2 expressions are positively related to age (r =0.26, P =0.040), weight (r =0.43, P<0.001), as well as BMI (r = 0.38, P =0.002), and male patients show higher expressions of ACE2 in lungs (P <0.05). ACE2 expressions are negatively related to peripheral eosinophils (r = -0.30, P =0.017). There was no correlation between ABO blood types and ACE2 expression in normal lung tissues (P > 0.05). IL-13 and IL-6R expression in lung tissue increased with age (r =0.26, P <0.05, for both). CONCLUSION: Our pathological evidences showed that the alveolar epithelia, vascular endothelia, and alveolar macrophages are susceptible in human lungs for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The risk factors such as high body weight/BMI, old age, male gender, and eosinopenia may be related to ACE2 expression in human lungs, and associated with more chance to develop the severe cases. IL-6R expression in lung tissue also increased with age. Therefore, weight control and smoking cessation are essential to reduce the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in obesity, old or male patients. Peripheral eosinophils monitor is also quite necessary to detect severe tendency in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Emergency measures in the face of the recent COVID-19 pandemic have been different among countries, although most have opted for confinement and restrictions on social contact. These measures have generated lifestyle changes with potential effects on individuals' health. The disturbances in daily routines due to confinement and remote work have impacted circadian rhythms and energy balance; however, the consequences of these disruptions have not been studied in depth. The objective was to evaluate the impact of 12-week confinement on body weight, considering changes in several external synchronizers of the biological clock. METHODS: The participants, 521 university students (16-35 years), responded to 52 questions oriented to determine light exposure, sleep patterns, sedentary lifestyle, and eating times. RESULTS: We found a reduction in sunlight exposure and sleep duration, an increment in sedentarism and screen exposure, and a delay in the timing of the main meals and sleep in the whole cohort. These behavioral changes were associated with a twofold increase in obesity. Subjects who increased their sedentary hours and shortened their sleep to a higher degree were those who gained more bodyweight. The most influential factors in body weight variation during confinement were sleep duration, physical activity (sedentarism), and light (timing of screen exposure). The mediation model explained 6% of the total body weight variation. CONCLUSIONS: Results support a significant impact of confinement on several external synchronizers of the biological clock and on body weight. Health-related recommendations during the pandemic must include behavioral recommendations to mitigate the adverse effects on the biological clock.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemics has created unprecedented challenges and threats to patients and healthcare systems worldwide. Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Among other important risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes, obesity has emerged along with undernutrition-malnutrition as a strong predictor of disease risk and severity. Obesity-related excessive body fat may lead to respiratory, metabolic and immune derangements potentially favoring the onset of COVID-19 complications. In addition, patients with obesity may be at risk for loss of skeletal muscle mass, reflecting a state of hidden malnutrition with a strong negative health impact in all clinical settings. Also importantly, obesity is commonly associated with micronutrient deficiencies that directly influence immune function and infection risk. Finally, the pandemic-related lockdown, deleterious lifestyle changes and other numerous psychosocial consequences may worsen eating behaviors, sedentarity, body weight regulation, ultimately leading to further increments of obesity-associated metabolic complications with loss of skeletal muscle mass and higher non-communicable disease risk. Therefore, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies should be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients in the presence of obesity; lockdown-induced health risks should also be specifically monitored and prevented in this population. In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) aims at providing clinical practice guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients with obesity in various clinical settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little evidence about how novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) affects pregnant women and their newborns. Comparisons with other members of the coronavirus family responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have been done to predict maternal and neonatal outcomes; however, more information is required to establish clinical patterns, disease evolution and pregnancy prognosis in this group of patients. METHODS: This paper is reporting a series of 91 women diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and puerperium. The analysis showed that 40 patients developed pneumonia, bilateral in most cases, with a 46.2% rate of hospitalization and 4 patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In confront with previous publications, we have found a higher rate of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severe forms, even when compared to non-pregnant women with the same baseline characteristics. We have analyzed the demographic characteristics, pregnancy-related conditions and presenting symptoms to identify features that could determine which patients will need hospitalization because of COVID-19 (Group 1-G1) and those who not (Group 2-G2). We have found that obesity and Latin-American origin behave as risk factors: OR: 4.3; 95% CI: 1.4-13.2, and OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.1‚Äâ-‚Äâ6.2, respectively. Among the 23 patients that delivered with active SARS-CoV-2, the overall rate of cesarean section (CS) and preterm birth were 52.2% and 34.8%, respectively, but we observed that the rate of CS was even higher in G1 compared to G2: 81.8% versus 25%, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ.012. However, prematurity was equally distributed in both groups and only one preterm delivery was determined by poor maternal condition. There were no deaths among the patients neither their newborns. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the results of our cohort reveal that SARSC-CoV-2 infection may not behave as mild as suggested during pregnancy, especially when factors as obesity or Latin-American origin are present. No evidence of late vertical transmission was noticed but prematurity and high CS rate were common findings, although it is difficult to establish any causality between these conditions and COVID-19. Further evidence is required to establish if pregnancy itself can lead to severe forms of COVID-19 disease and whether risk factors for the general population are applicable to obstetric patients. Until larger studies are available, pregnant women should be monitored carefully to anticipate severe complications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated emotional eating behaviours and perceived stress during COVID-19 partial quarantine according to BMI levels in healthy adults. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: An online survey including demographic variables, eating attitude-related questions, Emotional Eater Questionnaire (EEQ) and Perceived Stress Scale-14 (PSS-14) was sent via online data collection platform. Self-reported weight, height and weight changes during the quarantine were also collected. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 506 people aged between 20-65 years who were partially quarantined due to COVID-19 participated in this study. RESULTS: BMI was positively correlated with EEQ (r 0 ¬∑205, P = 0¬∑001). However, BMI was negatively linked with PSS-14 during COVID-19 (r -0¬∑125, P = 0¬∑001), indicating that participants with lower BMI had higher perceived stress during COVID-19. Participants gained weight during the lockdown situation (+1¬∑20 ¬± 1¬∑70 kg in men; +0¬∑91 ¬± 1¬∑40 kg in women). EEQ and PSS-14 scores of women found to be significantly higher than men (9¬∑39 ¬± 5¬∑37 in men v. 11¬∑17 ¬± 5¬∑85 in women for EEQ; 24¬∑67 ¬± 8¬∑32 in men v. 27¬∑99 ¬± 7¬∑34 in women for PSS-14). Obese participants consumed sweetened and carbonated drinks two-fold more in those compared with other participants. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that partial quarantine may be closely related to emotional eating and weight gain, and participants with higher BMI showed more emotional eating behaviours. Therefore, certain precautions should be considered beforehand in order not to cause long-term eating disorder problems.

AB  - It is well established that pre-existing comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), chronic kidney diseases (CKDs), cancers, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with increased severity and fatality of COVID-19. The increased death from COVID-19 is due to the unavailability of a gold standard therapeutic and, more importantly, the lack of understanding of how the comorbid conditions and COVID-19 interact at the molecular level, so that personalized management strategies can be adopted. Here, using multi-omics data sets and bioinformatics strategy, we identified the pathway crosstalk between COVID-19 and diabetes, hypertension, CVDs, CKDs, and cancers. Further, shared pathways and hub gene-based targets for COVID-19 and its associated specific and combination of comorbid conditions are also predicted towards developing personalized management strategies. The approved drugs for most of these identified targets are also provided towards drug repurposing. Literature supports the involvement of our identified shared pathways in pathogenesis of COVID-19 and development of the specific comorbid condition of interest. Similarly, shared pathways- and hub gene-based targets are also found to have potential implementations in managing COVID-19 patients. However, the identified targets and drugs need further careful evaluation for their repurposing towards personalized treatment of COVID-19 cases having pre-existing specific comorbid conditions we have considered in this analysis. The method applied here may also be helpful in identifying common pathway components and targets in other disease-disease interactions too.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health crisis. Possible pancreatic involvement has recently been observed in these patients; however, its significance is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of significantly elevated lipase with disease outcomes. METHODS: Data about demographics, symptoms, laboratory values, and clinical outcomes were collected for 1,003 consecutive patients testing positive for COVID-19. Elevated lipase was defined as greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (>3 √ó ULN). Baseline characteristics among patients with or without elevated lipase were compared using Fisher exact test or Student t-test for categorical or numerical variables, respectively. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of lipase levels with primary clinical outcomes (intensive care unit admission and intubation) adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, history of diabetes, and hypertension. RESULTS: Of 1,003 patients with COVID-19, 83 had available lipase levels and were all admitted to the hospital. Of 83, 14 (16.8%) had elevated lipase (>3 √ó ULN), which was associated with higher rates of leukocytosis (P < 0.001) and abnormal liver enzymes (P < 0.01). Compared with lower lipase levels (<3 √ó ULN), patients with elevated lipase had higher rates of ICU admission (92.9% vs 32.8%; P < 0.001) and intubation (78.6% vs 23.5%; P 0.002). In a multivariable-adjusted model, higher lipase levels were significantly associated with admission to the ICU and rate of intubation. DISCUSSION: Lipase elevation is seen in COVID-19 and is associated with worse disease outcomes.

AB  - The autopsy findings for 3 cases of SARS-(CoV-2) pneumonia-related deaths are reported with pulmonary histology and immunohistochemistry findings. In 2 cases (cases 1 and 2), the time interval from presentation to death was approximately 1 week, whereas for case 3, the time interval from presentation to death was hours. Case 1 and case 2 presented with shortness of breath, cough, and flu-like symptoms. The decedent from case 3 died shortly after presenting to a local emergency room with high fever, chest and abdominal pain, and shortness of breath. All 3 cases had 1 or more comorbidities. The postmortem interval for cases 1 and 2 was 2 weeks as they died at sea and were stored on board within the respective cruise ships' refrigeration units, whereas case 3 was examined within 24 hours of death. The autopsies were conducted at the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiners Department under routine infectious precautions. Salient clinical history and autopsy findings are summarized. Microscopic examination revealed pneumonia with associated atypical endovascular cells.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate patient characteristics and factors that increase the risk of being admitted to intensive care and that influence survival in cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One-hundred and ninety-one SARS-CoV-2 patients were admitted to the "Fondazione Poliambulanza di Brescia" Hospital (Brescia, Lombardy, Italy) in the period 1st March 2020 to 11th April 2020. Data on demographics, clinical presentation at admission, co-morbidities, pharmacological treatment, admission to intensive care and death was recorded. Logistic regression and survival analysis were carried out to investigate the risk of being admitted to intensive care and the risk of death. RESULTS: The mean age of the study cohort was 64.6¬±9.9 years (range 20-88). Median BMI was 28.5¬±5 kg/m2. Fever (81%) and dyspnea (65%) were the most common symptoms on admission. Most of patients (63%) had at least one co-existing disease. The 157 (82%) patients admitted to intensive care were more likely to be of intermediate age (60-69 years; OR 3.23, 95% CI 1.32-8.38), overweight (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.02-7.07) or obese (OR 5.63, 95% CI 1.73-21.09) and with lymphocytopenia (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.17-6.89) than the 34 patients admitted to the ordinary ward. During intensive care, 50% of patients died and their death was associated with older age (HR 2.06, 95% CI 1.07-3.97), obesity (HR 2.23, 95% CI 1.15-4.35) and male gender (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.02-3.57). CONCLUSIONS: We found that admission to intensive care and poor survival were associated with advanced age and higher body mass index, albeit with differences in statistical significance. Pre-existing diseases and symptoms on admission were not associated with different clinical outcomes. Interestingly, male gender was more prevalent among SARS-CoV-2 patients and was related negatively to survival, but it was not associated with more frequent admission to intensive care.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that black people and other minorities have a higher incidence of severe COVID-19 disease, but little is known about the situation of children, especially in Europe. In general children are less infected and if so, frequently show mild or asymptomatic disease, making conclusions difficult. We collected data on SARS-CoV-2 associated hospitalizations in a well-defined population of 550,180 children up to 15 years in five hub-centers during the "first wave" at the heart of the pandemic in Northern Italy. Among the 451,053 Italian citizens 80 were hospitalized as compared to 31 out of 99,127 foreign citizens, giving a significantly higher risk (odds ratio 1.76; 95% CI: 1.16-2.66) for the foreign children. The risk was highest for children of African ethnicity as compared to Italians with an odds ratio of 2.76 (95% CI: 1.56-4.87). None of the patients deceased. There was no significant difference in age (thou infants regardless of ethnicity had a 10-fold higher risk), sex, length of hospitalization or comorbidities, namely overweight. As bureaucratic, cultural and information barriers mostly affect preventive and adult services and considering that in contrast to other countries, in Italy pediatric care is guaranteed free of (out-of-pocket) charge to all people <16 years, and hospitals are densely spaced, access to health care seems to be a minor problem. Thus, other possible root causes are discussed. We believe that this is an unbiased starting point to understand and overcome the reasons for the higher risk those children experience.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 raised numerous questions on the interactions between the occurrence of new infections, the environment, climate and health. The European Union requested the H2020 HERA project which aims at setting priorities in research on environment, climate and health, to identify relevant research needs regarding Covid-19. The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be related to urbanization, habitat destruction, live animal trade, intensive livestock farming and global travel. The contribution of climate and air pollution requires additional studies. Importantly, the severity of COVID-19 depends on the interactions between the viral infection, ageing and chronic diseases such as metabolic, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and obesity which are themselves influenced by environmental stressors. The mechanisms of these interactions deserve additional scrutiny. Both the pandemic and the social response to the disease have elicited an array of behavioural and societal changes that may remain long after the pandemic and that may have long term health effects including on mental health. Recovery plans are currently being discussed or implemented and the environmental and health impacts of those plans are not clearly foreseen. Clearly, COVID-19 will have a long-lasting impact on the environmental health field and will open new research perspectives and policy needs.

AB  - PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a lockdown in many countries, which induced negative dietary habits and sedentary behavior. Studies suggest that weight loss of patients undergoing bariatric surgery was equally affected. The aim was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on weight loss, obesity-related comorbidities, and nutritional status at 1-year follow-up after gastric bypass (GB). METHODS: Retrospective observational case-control study of patients undergoing primary GB in a tertiary referral Belgian center. COVID-19 period group was composed by those whose 1-year postoperative period was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown: from October 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020. The control group was composed of patients operated from October 1, 2018, to March 31, 2019. Electronic clinical records were reviewed searching: baseline characteristics, weight and comorbidities evolution, and biochemical values. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients in the COVID-19 period group and 66 in the non-COVID-19 period group were analyzed. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics. A reduced weight loss was observed at 1-year follow-up, in terms of percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) (82.4%¬†[SD:¬†21.6] vs. 82.4%¬†[SD:¬†21.6]; p:¬†0.043) and body mass index (BMI) (27.8¬†kg/m(2)¬†[IQR:¬†25.8-30.0] vs. 26.2¬†kg/m(2)¬†[IQR:¬†24.6-28.6]; p:¬†0.029) for COVID-19 period group vs. non-COVID-19 period group, respectively. There was a similar reduction of obesity-related comorbidities, without clinically significant differences in the nutritional follow-up. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown had an impact on weight loss at 1-year follow-up after gastric bypass.

AB  - PURPOSE: Community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in Spain in February 2020, with 216% intensive care unit (ICU) capacity expanded in Vitoria by March 18(th), 2020. METHODS: We identified patients from the two public hospitals in Vitoria who were admitted to ICU with confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2. Data reported here were available in April 6th, 2020. Mortality was assessed in those who completed 15-days of ICU stay. RESULTS: We identified 48 patients (27 males) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] age of patients was 63 [51-75] years. Symptoms began a median of 7 [5-12] days before ICU admission. The most common comorbidities identified were obesity (48%), arterial hypertension (44%) and chronic lung disease (37%). All patients were admitted by hypoxemic respiratory failure and none received non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Forty-five (94%) underwent intubation, 3 (6%) high flow nasal therapy (HFNT), 1 (2%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and 22 (46%) required prone position. After 15 days, 14/45 (31%) intubated patients died (13% within one week), 10/45 (22%) were extubated, and 21/45 (47%) underwent mechanical ventilation. Six patients had documented super-infection. Procalcitonin plasma above 0.5Œºg/L was associated with 16% vs. 19% (p=0.78) risk of death after 7 days. CONCLUSION: This early experience with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain suggests that a strategy of right oxygenation avoiding non-invasive mechanical ventilation was life-saving. Seven-day mortality in SARS-CoV-2 requiring intubation was lower than 15%, with 80% of patients still requiring mechanical ventilation. After 15 days of ICU admission, half of patients remained intubated, whereas one third died.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID 19-related quarantine led to a sudden and radical lifestyle changes, in particular in eating habits. Objectives of the study were to investigate the effect of quarantine on sleep quality (SQ) and body mass index (BMI), and if change in SQ was related to working modalities. MATERIALS: We enrolled 121 adults (age 44.9‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ13.3¬†years and 35.5% males). Anthropometric parameters, working modalities and physical activity were studied. Sleep quality was evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. At baseline, the enrolled subjects were assessed in outpatient clinic and after 40¬†days of quarantine/lockdown by phone interview. RESULTS: Overall, 49.6% of the subjects were good sleepers (PSQI‚Äâ<‚Äâ5) at the baseline and significantly decreased after quarantine (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). In detail, sleep onset latency (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001), sleep efficiency (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.03), sleep disturbances (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001), and daytime dysfunction (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001) significantly worsened. There was also a significant increase in BMI values in normal weight (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.023), in subjects grade I (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.027) and II obesity (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.020). In all cohort, physical activity was significantly decreased (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.004). However, analyzing the data according gender difference, males significantly decreased physical activity as well as females in which there was only a trend without reaching statistical significance (53.5% vs 25.6%; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.015 and 50.0% vs 35.9%, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.106; in males and females, respectively). In addition, smart working activity resulted in a significant worsening of SQ, particularly in males (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Quarantine was associated to a worsening of SQ, particularly in males doing smart working, and to an increase in BMI values.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop and validate a risk score to predict severe respiratory failure (SRF) among patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We performed a multicentre cohort study among hospitalized (>24¬†hours) patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from 22 February to 3 April 2020, at 11 Italian hospitals. Patients were divided into derivation and validation cohorts according to random sorting of hospitals. SRF was assessed from admission to hospital discharge and was defined as: Spo(2) <93% with 100% Fio(2), respiratory rate >30 breaths/min or respiratory distress. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to identify predictors of SRF, Œ≤-coefficients were used to develop a risk score. Trial Registration NCT04316949. RESULTS: We analysed 1113 patients (644 derivation, 469 validation cohort). Mean (¬±SD) age was 65.7 (¬±15) years, 704 (63.3%) were male. SRF occurred in 189/644 (29%) and 187/469 (40%) patients in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. At multivariate analysis, risk factors for SRF in the derivation cohort assessed at hospitalization were age ‚â•70¬†years (OR 2.74; 95% CI 1.66-4.50), obesity (OR 4.62; 95% CI 2.78-7.70), body temperature ‚â•38¬∞C (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.30-2.29), respiratory rate ‚â•22 breaths/min (OR 3.75; 95% CI 2.01-7.01), lymphocytes ‚â§900¬†cells/mm(3) (OR 2.69; 95% CI 1.60-4.51), creatinine ‚â•1 mg/dL (OR 2.38; 95% CI 1.59-3.56), C-reactive protein ‚â•10 mg/dL (OR 5.91; 95% CI 4.88-7.17) and lactate dehydrogenase ‚â•350 IU/L (OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.11-5.11). Assigning points to each variable, an individual risk score (PREDI-CO score) was obtained. Area under the receiver-operator curve was 0.89 (0.86-0.92). At a score of >3, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 71.6% (65%-79%), 89.1% (86%-92%), 74% (67%-80%) and 89% (85%-91%), respectively. PREDI-CO score showed similar prognostic ability in the validation cohort: area under the receiver-operator curve 0.85 (0.81-0.88). At a score of >3, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 80% (73%-85%), 76% (70%-81%), 69% (60%-74%) and 85% (80%-89%), respectively. CONCLUSION: PREDI-CO score can be useful to allocate resources and prioritize treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To report the methods and findings of two complete autopsies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive individuals who died in Oklahoma (United States) in March 2020. METHODS: Complete postmortem examinations were performed according to standard procedures in a negative-pressure autopsy suite/isolation room using personal protective equipment, including N95 masks, eye protection, and gowns. The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing on postmortem swabs. RESULTS: A 77-year-old obese man with a history of hypertension, splenectomy, and 6 days of fever and chills died while being transported for medical care. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on postmortem nasopharyngeal and lung parenchymal swabs. Autopsy revealed diffuse alveolar damage and chronic inflammation and edema in the bronchial mucosa. A 42-year-old obese man with a history of myotonic dystrophy developed abdominal pain followed by fever, shortness of breath, and cough. Postmortem nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2; lung parenchymal swabs were negative. Autopsy showed acute bronchopneumonia with evidence of aspiration. Neither autopsy revealed viral inclusions, mucus plugging in airways, eosinophils, or myocarditis. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 testing can be performed at autopsy. Autopsy findings such as diffuse alveolar damage and airway inflammation reflect true virus-related pathology; other findings represent superimposed or unrelated processes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Secure forensic mental health services treat patients with high rates of treatment-resistant psychoses. High rates of obesity and medical comorbidities are common. Population-based studies have identified high-risk groups in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those with problems such as obesity, lung disease and immune-compromising conditions. Structured assessment tools exist to ascertain the risk of adverse outcome in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection. AIMS: To assess risk of adverse outcome in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a complete population of forensic psychiatry patients using structured assessment tools. METHOD: All patients of a national forensic mental health service (n = 141) were rated for risk of adverse outcome in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection, using two structured tools, the COVID-Age tool and the COVID-Risk tool. RESULTS: We found high rates of relevant physical comorbidities. Mean chronological age was 45.5 years (s.d. = 11.4, median 44.1), mean score on the COVID-Age tool was 59.1 years (s.d. = 19.4, median 58.0), mean difference was 13.6 years (s.d. = 15.6), paired t = 10.9, d.f. = 140, P < 0.001. Three patients (2.1%) were chronologically over 70 years of age, compared with 43 (30.5%) with a COVID-Age over 70 (œá2 = 6.99, d.f. = 1, P = 0.008, Fisher's exact test P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Patients in secure forensic psychiatric services represent a high-risk group for adverse outcomes in the event of SARS-COV-2 infection. Population-based guidance on self-isolation and other precautions based on chronological age may not be sufficient. There is an urgent need for better physical health research and treatment in this group.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by a novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), similar to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which cause acute respiratory distress syndrome and case fatalities. COVID-19 disease severity is worse in older obese patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease. Cell binding and entry of betacoronaviruses is via their surface spike glycoprotein; SARS-CoV binds to the metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), MERS-CoV utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and recent modeling of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein predicts that it can interact with human DPP4 in addition to ACE2. DPP4 is a ubiquitous membrane-bound aminopeptidase that circulates in plasma; it is multifunctional with roles in nutrition, metabolism, and immune and endocrine systems. DPP4 activity differentially regulates glucose homeostasis and inflammation via its enzymatic activity and nonenzymatic immunomodulatory effects. The importance of DPP4 for the medical community has been highlighted by the approval of DPP4 inhibitors, or gliptins, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review discusses the dysregulation of DPP4 in COVID-19 comorbid conditions; DPP4 activity is higher in older individuals and increased plasma DPP4 is a predictor of the onset of metabolic syndrome. DPP4 upregulation may be a determinant of COVID-19 disease severity, which creates interest regarding the use of gliptins in management of COVID-19. Also, knowledge of the chemistry and biology of DPP4 could be utilized to develop novel therapies to block viral entry of some betacoronaviruses, potentially including SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a public health crisis and has placed a significant burden on healthcare systems. Patients with underlying metabolic dysfunction, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, are at a higher risk for COVID-19 complications, including multi-organ dysfunction, secondary to a deranged immune response, and cellular energy deprivation. These patients are at a baseline state of chronic inflammation associated with increased susceptibility to the severe immune manifestations of COVID-19, which are triggered by the cellular hypoxic environment and cytokine storm. The altered metabolic profile and energy generation of immune cells affect their activation, exacerbating the imbalanced immune response. Key immunometabolic interactions may inform the development of an efficacious treatment for COVID-19. Novel therapeutic approaches with repurposed drugs, such as PPAR agonists, or newly developed molecules such as the antagomirs, which block microRNA function, have shown promising results. Those treatments, alone or in combination, target both immune and metabolic pathways and are ideal for septic COVID-19 patients with an underlying metabolic condition.

AB  - Clinical and laboratory predictors of COVID-19 severity are now well described and combined to propose mortality or severity scores. However, they all necessitate saturable equipment such as scanners, or procedures difficult to implement such as blood gas measures. To provide an easy and fast COVID-19 severity risk score upon hospital admission, and keeping in mind the above limits, we sought for a scoring system needing limited invasive data such as a simple blood test and co-morbidity assessment by anamnesis. A retrospective study of 303 patients (203 from Bordeaux University hospital and an external independent cohort of 100 patients from Paris Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re hospital) collected clinical and biochemical parameters at admission. Using stepwise model selection by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), we built the severity score Covichem. Among 26 tested variables, 7: obesity, cardiovascular conditions, plasma sodium, albumin, ferritin, LDH and CK were the independent predictors of severity used in Covichem (accuracy 0.87, AUROC 0.91). Accuracy was 0.92 in the external validation cohort (89% sensitivity and 95% specificity). Covichem score could be useful as a rapid, costless and easy to implement severity assessment tool during acute COVID-19 pandemic waves.

AB  - The emergence of COVID-19 in the United States led most states to close or severely limit the capacity of their early child-care and education (ECE) programs. This loss affected millions of young children, including many of the 4.6 million low-income children who are provided free meals and snacks by their ECE programs through support from the federal Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP).Although Congress swiftly authorized waivers that would allow CACFP-participating ECE programs to continue distributing food to children, early evidence suggests that most ECE programs did not have the capacity to do so, leaving a fragmented system of federal, state, and local food programs to fill the gaps created by this loss.Critical steps are needed to repair our nation's fragile ECE system, including greater investment in CACFP, to ensure the nutrition, health, and development of young children during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

AB  - On the 9th March 2020, the first patient with COVID-19 was admitted to ICU in the Royal Gwent Hospital (RGH), Newport, Wales. We prospectively recorded the rate of ICU admissions of 52 patients with COVID-19 over 60 days, focusing on the epidemiology of ethnicity and deprivation because these factors have emerged as significant risk factors. Patients were 65% (34 of 52) male and had a median (IQR) age of 55 (48-62) years. Prevalent comorbidities included obesity (52%); diabetes (33%), and asthma (23%). COVID-19 hospital and ICU inpatient numbers peaked on days 23 and 39, respectively-a lag of 16 days. The ICU mortality rate was 33% (17 of 52). People of black, Asian, and minority ethnic descent (BAME group) represented 35% of ICU COVID-19 admissions (18 of 52) and 35% of deaths (6 of 17). Amongst the BAME group, 72% (13 of 18) of patients were found to reside in geographical areas representing the 20% most deprived in Wales, vs. 27% of patients in the Caucasian group (9 of 33). Less than 5% of the population within the area covered by RGH are of BAME descent, yet this group had a disproportionately high ICU admission and mortality rate from COVID-19. The interplay between ethnicity and deprivation, which is complex, may be a factor in our findings. This in turn could be related to an increased prevalence of co-morbidities; higher community exposure; larger proportion of lower band key worker roles; or genetic polymorphisms.

AB  - It is evident that health disparities exist during the COVID-19 pandemic, a pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Underlying reasons for COVID-19 health disparities are multi-factorial. However, social determinants, including those regarding socioeconomic status, social inequalities, health behaviors, and stress, may have implications on these disparities. Exposure to one or more of these social determinants is associated with heightened inflammatory responses, particularly increases in the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as immune system dysfunction. Thus, an amplified effect during COVID-19 could occur, potentially resulting in vulnerable patients experiencing an intensified cytokine storm due to a hyperactive and dysfunctional immune response. Further understanding how social determinants play a mechanistic role in COVID-19 disparities could potentially help reduce health disparities overall and in future pandemics.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe presentation, hospital course, and predictors of bad outcome in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). METHODS: Retrospective data review of a case series of children meeting the published definition for MIS-C who were discharged or died between March 1, 2020, and June 15, 2020, from 33 participating European, Asian, and American hospitals. Data were collected through a Web-based survey and included clinical, laboratory, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic findings and treatment management. RESULTS: We included 183 patients with MIS-C: male sex, 109 (59.6%); mean age 7.0 ¬± 4.7 years; Black race, 56 (30.6%); obesity, 48 (26.2%). Overall, 114 of 183 (62.3%) had evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. All presented with fever, 117 of 183 (63.9%) with gastrointestinal symptoms, and 79 of 183 (43.2%) with shock, which was associated with Black race, higher inflammation, and imaging abnormalities. Twenty-seven patients (14.7%) fulfilled criteria for Kawasaki disease. These patients were younger and had no shock and fewer gastrointestinal, cardiorespiratory, and neurologic symptoms. The remaining 77 patients (49.3%) had mainly fever and inflammation. Inotropic support, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were indicated in 72 (39.3%), 43 (23.5%), and 4 (2.2%) patients, respectively. A shorter duration of symptoms before admission was found to be associated with poor patient outcome and for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and/or death, with 72.3% (95% confidence interval: 0.56-0.90; P = .006) increased risk per day reduction and 63.3% (95% confidence interval: 0.47-0.82; P < .0001) increased risk per day reduction respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this case series, children with MIS-C presented with a wide clinical spectrum, including Kawasaki disease-like, life-threatening shock and milder forms with mainly fever and inflammation. A shorter duration of symptoms before admission was associated with a worse outcome.

AB  - AIM: Associations of depression, dementia, and poor life quality with mortality of COVID-19have not been studied yet. We aimed to identify the risk factors for mortality and analyze the associations with patients' physiological and mental well-being, as reflected by comorbidities, life quality, depression, and cognitive impairment. METHODS: : Older patients receiving inpatient hospital care for COVID-19 were included.Demographic data, medical history, symptoms at admission, laboratory findings, and treatment outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: : There were 122 patients with a median age of 73.0¬†years. The mortality rate was 9.0% (n¬†=¬†11 patients). Patients with mortality were significantly active smokers, obese, and having comorbidities using polypharmacy. Weight loss ‚â•of 10% during hospitalization was significantly associated with mortality.Poor life quality and a higher risk of depression, cognitive impairment, and falling were more frequently seen in non-survived patients. (p¬†<¬†0.05). High ferritin was the only independent risk factor for mortality (OR¬†=¬†15.61, 95% CI:1.08-226.09, p =¬†0.044). CONCLUSION: : The presence of comorbidities, depression, cognitive impairment, higher falling risk, and poor life quality were significantly associated with higher mortality rates in older adults with COVID-19. High ferritin level was an independent risk factor for mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The precautions taken during the pandemic period may cause stress-related eating behavior disorders. It was aimed to test this hypothesis, and the study was carried out to examine pandemic measures the effect of on the nutritional, depression and stress conditions of people with obesity. METHODS: The individuals who participated in the study were people with obesity who received follow-up dietary therapy in a private hospital. Three separate scales were applied to the individuals, which measured the desire to overeating request, depression status and stress-fighting status. RESULTS: This study was conducted on 368 individuals. Women had lower values of BMI (28.57¬±3.89 kg/cm(2)) than men (30.64¬±2.87 kg/cm(2)). When the scores of the excessive eating request scale mean scores before and during the pandemic were examined, it was seen that the scores of the individuals increased during the pandemic. In the multivariate regression model, it was seen that the increase of stress and BMI increased the FCQ score (p<0.001). Multiple regression models were created by taking into account the criteria that caused the score increase. Each variable can predict the FCQ score separately. The predictor significance order of variants on FCQ score Œ≤ values is as follows: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (Œ≤=0.774), before pandemic FCQ (Œ≤=0.601), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (Œ≤=-0.268), before pandemic BMI(a) (Œ≤=-0.223), during pandemic BMI(b) (Œ≤=0.073), and age (Œ≤=-0.013). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic, making applications such as quarantine in pandemic processes has successful results in being able to combat its. However, undesirable conditions such as stress can have serious negative consequences on other health measurements. It was observed in the results of this study that excessive eating food desire developed in people with obesity.

AB  - There has been a markedly renewed interest in factors associated with pneumonia, a leading cause of death worldwide, due to its frequent concurrence with pandemics of influenza and Covid-19 disease. Reported predisposing factors to both bacterial pneumonia and pandemic viral lower respiratory infections are wintertime occurrence, older age, obesity, pre-existing cardiopulmonary conditions and diabetes. Also implicated are age-related neurodegenerative diseases that cause parkinsonism and dementia. We investigated the prevalence of autopsy-proven pneumonia in the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders (AZSAND), a longitudinal clinicopathological study, between the years 2006 and 2019 and before the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Of 691 subjects dying at advanced ages (mean 83.4), pneumonia was diagnosed postmortem in 343 (49.6%). There were 185 subjects without dementia or parkinsonism while clinicopathological diagnoses for the other subjects included 319 with Alzheimer's disease dementia, 127 with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, 72 with dementia with Lewy bodies, 49 with progressive supranuclear palsy and 78 with vascular dementia. Subjects with one or more of these neurodegenerative diseases all had higher pneumonia rates, ranging between 50 and 61%, as compared to those without dementia or parkinsonism (40%). In multivariable logistic regression models, male sex and a non-summer death both had independent contributions (ORs of 1.67 and 1.53) towards the presence of pneumonia at autopsy while the absence of parkinsonism or dementia was a significant negative predictor of pneumonia (OR 0.54). Male sex, dementia and parkinsonism may also be risk factors for Covid-19 pneumonia. The apolipoprotein E4 allele, as well as obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, cardiomegaly and cigarette smoking history, were not significantly associated with pneumonia, in contradistinction to what has been reported for Covid-19 disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Knowledge on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in liver transplant recipients is lacking, particularly in terms of severity of the disease. The aim of this study was to describe the demographic, baseline clinical characteristics and early outcomes of a European cohort of liver transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: We conducted an international prospective study across Europe on liver transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by microbiological assay during the first outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, management of immunosuppressive therapy and outcomes were collected. RESULTS: 57 patients were included (70% male, median (IQR) age at diagnosis 65 (57-70) years). 21 (37%), 32 (56%) and 21 (37%) patients had one cardiovascular disease, arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus, respectively. The most common symptoms were fever (79%), cough (55%), dyspnoea (46%), fatigue or myalgia (56%) and GI symptoms (33%). Immunosuppression was reduced in 22 recipients (37%) and discontinued in 4 (7%). With this regard, no impact on outcome was observed. Forty-one (72%) subjects were hospitalised and 11 (19%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. Overall, we estimated a case fatality rate of 12% (95% CI 5% to 24%), which increased to 17% (95% CI 7% to 32%) among hospitalised patients. Five out of the seven patients who died had a history of cancer. CONCLUSION: In this European multicentre prospective study of liver transplant recipients, COVID-19 was associated with an overall and in-hospital fatality rate of 12% (95% CI 5% to 24%) and 17% (95% CI 7% to 32%), respectively. A history of cancer was more frequent in patients with poorer outcome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on parental perceptions of health behaviors and food insecurity among children with overweight and obesity living in San Francisco and to assess the relationship between food insecurity and dietary intake during the pandemic. METHODS: Parents of children ages 4 to 12 in San Francisco with body mass index ‚â•85th percentile measured at a clinic visit at a Federally Qualified Health Center or academic practice from January 1st to March 15th, 2020 were eligible to participate. Parents completed a survey reporting on child health behaviors and household food insecurity prior to and since the start of the pandemic. Survey items were abstracted from validated surveys with adaptations. Regression models evaluated associations between food insecurity and dietary intake variables. RESULTS: Most participants (n¬†=¬†145) were publicly insured (90%), Latino (77%), and spoke Spanish at home (70%). Parents perceived that child mean daily nonacademic screen time was higher during the pandemic compared to before (3.8 hours vs 1.6 hours). Mean daily physical activity was reported to be lower compared to prior to the pandemic (1 hour vs 1.8 hours). On average, reported bedtime shifted 1.6 hours later. Food insecurity increased significantly but was not associated with intake of fruits, vegetables, sugar-sweetened beverages, or foods with added sugar during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Parents of children with overweight or obesity in San Francisco perceive increased child screen time, decreased physical activity and later bedtimes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings suggest a need for policies that support healthy lifestyle behaviors among low-income children during the pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to over 2.26 million deaths for almost 104 million confirmed cases worldwide, as of 4 February 2021 (WHO). Risk factors include pre-existing conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Although several vaccines have been deployed, there are few alternative anti-viral treatments available in the case of reduced or non-existent vaccine protection. Adopting a long-term holistic approach to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic appears critical with the emergence of novel and more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our objective was to identify comorbidity-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), potentially conferring increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection using a computational meta-analysis approach. SNP datasets were downloaded from a publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) catalog for 141 of 258 candidate COVID-19 comorbidities. Gene-level SNP analysis was performed to identify significant pathways by using the program MAGMA. An SNP annotation program was used to analyze MAGMA-identified genes. Differential gene expression was determined for significant genes across 30 general tissue types using the Functional and Annotation Mapping of GWAS online tool GENE2FUNC. COVID-19 comorbidities (n = 22) from six disease categories were found to have significant associated pathways, validated by Q-Q plots (p < 0.05). Protein-protein interactions of significant (p < 0.05) differentially expressed genes were visualized with the STRING program. Gene interaction networks were found to be relevant to SARS and influenza pathogenesis. In conclusion, we were able to identify the pathways potentially affected by or affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in underlying medical conditions likely to confer susceptibility and/or the severity of COVID-19. Our findings have implications in future COVID-19 experimental research and treatment development.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the risk of acute and late radiation-induced toxicity in patients with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All the patients irradiated in Institut Curie from March to July 2020 were included if the first symptoms related to COVID-19 occurred no more than two months before the start of radiation therapy (RT) or 15‚Äâdays after the end of RT. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were included in this analysis. Twenty-five patients had no co-morbidities (86.2%), including morbid obesity. The diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was based on a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test for 18 patients (62.1%), a positive serology test for three patients (10.3%), and/or radiologic findings for 12 patients (41.4%). Three patients with symptoms highly suggestive of COVID-19 were included, although they had negative biologic tests and did not have a chest CT scan. Median time from the diagnosis of COVID-19 to the onset of RT was 5.5‚Äâdays. Modification of RT course due to COVID-19 status was observed in 15 patients, including four for whom RT was definitively stopped. Six patients needed hospitalization for hypoxemic lung disease requiring intensive care. The majority of patients did not experience severe (> grade 2) acute toxicity. After a median follow-up of 6‚Äâmonths (IQR, 1-9‚Äâmonths), none of the patients had unusual clinical or radiological late toxicities. CONCLUSION: The observed acute and late toxicities were ultimately similar to those observed in a population not infected with COVID-19. These results do not prompt modification of standard RT protocols for irradiation of COVID-19 patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has recently been argued that asthma does not increase the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. If so, the prevalence of asthma in subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 should be lower than in the general population. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of asthma in Mexican children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A public database of the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico was analyzed. Those who underwent the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-SARS-CoV-2 (rtRT-PCR-SARS-CoV-2) test from February 27 to June 21, 2020, were included. In addition to the prevalence of asthma, some factors associated with it were investigated. RESULTS: Data from 417,366 subjects were analyzed. Asthma prevalence in children, adults, and global were 3.7%, 3.3%, and 3.3%, respectively. Although the asthma prevalence was lower in SARS-CoV-2 positive over negative patients, significant differences were only found in adults (2.8% vs. 3.7% respectively; odds ratio (OR) = 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71-0.77); but not in children (3.5% vs. 3.8%, respectively; OR = 0.91; 95%CI: 0.76-1.10). Multivariate analysis showed in younger than 18 years that girls and immunosuppression were factors associated with a decrease in the odds to develop asthma. In adults, asthma was positively associated with females, obesity, smoking, immunosuppression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arterial hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of asthma in child and adult were lower than those previously reported. Our study seems to support the hypothesis that asthma patients have a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are required to demonstrate the consistency of our findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic varies greatly and has different dynamics in every country, city, and hospital in Latin America. Obesity increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it is one of the independent risk factors for the most severe cases of COVID-19. Currently, the most effective treatment against obesity available is bariatric and metabolic surgery (BMS), which further resolves or improves other independent risk factors like diabetes and hypertension. OBJECTIVE: Provide recommendations for the resumption of elective BMS during COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: This document was created by the IFSO-LAC Executive Board and a task force. Based on data collected from a survey distributed to all IFSO-LAC members that obtained 540 responses, current evidence available, and consensus reached by other scientific societies. RESULTS: The resumption of elective BMS must be a priority maybe similar to oncological surgery, when hospitals reach phase I or II, treating obesity patients in a NON-COVID area, avoiding inadvertent intrahospital contagion from healthcare provider, patients, and relatives. Same BMS indication and types of procedures as before the pandemic. Discard the presence of SARS-CoV-2 within 72¬†h prior to surgery. Continues laparoscopic approach. The entire team use N95 mask. Minimum hospital stays. Implement remote visits for the follow-up. CONCLUSION: Resumption of elective BMS is crucial because it is not only a weight loss operation but also resolves or improves comorbidities and appears to be an immune restorative procedure of obese patients in the medium term, offering them the same probability of contracting COVID-19 as the regular population.

AB  - PURPOSE: The COVID-19 outbreak has forced a 2-month lockdown (LD) in Spain. We aimed to assess how that had affected our cohort of bariatric patients waiting for surgery. METHODS: A review of electronic records and a structured phone interview with each patient were conducted. Changes in severity of obesity were analyzed using the Obesity Surgery Score (OSS) and changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using the validated EQ-5D questionnaire. Other miscellaneous questions about behavior modifications and surgical risk perception were also analyzed. RESULTS: All 51 patients fully answered the questionnaires. Mean age was 47 years and mean time on waiting list 91 days. Mean BMI increased during LD (42.7 vs 43.2; p < 0.001). Both OSS (2.84 vs 3; p = 0.011) and EQ-5D (69 vs 64; p < 0.001) mildly worsened during LD, mainly due to psychosocial issues. Twenty-seven patients (53%) thought that perioperative risks were higher under the current circumstances but they were as willing to undergo surgery as those who believed that the risks had not increased (74% vs 87%, p = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 LD had a significant but mild effect on our cohort of bariatric surgery waiting list patients. Although perioperative risk perception had increased, patients were still willing to undergo their planned surgeries.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a major risk factor for severe forms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but little is known about the post-bariatric surgery (BS) setting. The prevalence of likely COVID-19 and its risk factors in patients followed up after BS was assessed. METHODS: A total of 738 patients who underwent BS and were followed up at a university medical center were surveyed. A retrospective comparison of characteristics at baseline, 1 year after BS, and at the time of lockdown was performed between patients with COVID-19-likely events (CL) based on a combination of reported symptoms and those for whom COVID-19 was unlikely. RESULTS: CL occurred in 62 (8.4%) patients, among whom 4 (6.4%) had a severe form requiring hospitalization and 1 (1.6%) died. The CL group had a higher proportion of persistent type 2 diabetes (T2D) at last follow-up (36.2% vs. 20.3%, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.01). BMI at the time of lockdown was lower in the CL group (30.2‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ5.1 vs. 32.8‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ6.5 kg/m(2) ; P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01) with higher percent weight loss since BS in the CL group. Severe forms of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization were associated with persistent T2D at the last follow-up visit. CONCLUSIONS: In BS patients, CL were associated with persistent T2D and lower BMI.

AB  - The overall intestinal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) composition in the individuals with obesity could be shifted away from immunosilent/immunoinhibitory Bacteroidetes LPS subtypes, in favor of various proinflammatory LPS subtypes due to gut microbiome dysbiosis. What is more, high-fat diet, as well as obesity per se, enhance intestinal permeability through various mechanisms. Latter results in increased paracellular absorption and transcellular (via chylomicrons) transport of endogenous endotoxin in the circulatory system (endotoxemia). In addition, it is known that lipid A initiates a signaling cascade resulting in activation of various proinflammatory pathways and increases oxidative stress upon binding to tool-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Taking everything into consideration, it is very likely that gut microbiome dysbiosis and endotoxemia represent the additional pathophysiological explanation for increased COVID-19 severity in obesity.
