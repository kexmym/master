AB  - BACKGROUND Daratumumab is an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody that is used more frequently in patients with Multiple Myeloma (MM). Multiple studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of daratumumab for relapsed/refractory MM and primary treatment for transplant eligible and ineligible patients. METHODS We conducted an integrated safety analysis to characterize the frequency, severity, natural history, and outcomes of adverse events (AEs) with daratumumab versus comparators. Data were pooled from 5 completed phase III randomized controlled studies that had included 1798 daratumumabtreated and 1797 comparator-treated patients with MM as a first line in both transplant eligible and transplant ineligible and for relapsed/refractory disease(Table.1). Safety analyses included reporting of AEs using crude and exposure-adjusted incidence rates. RESULTS The median follow up duration is 16.84 months (range: 7.4-28 months) for both daratumumab-treated and comparator-treated patients. Discontinuation for any reason occurred less often with daratumumab (22% vs. 33.9%) though discontinuation because of AEs occurred at similar rates (25% vs.26%) as well as deaths due to AEs occurred at similar rates (2.25% vs. 1.84%). When adjusted to exposure, neutropenia, lymphopenia, diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, pneumonia and hypertension were the only common grade 3 AEs more often reported with daratumumab than with the comparators(Table.2). The prevalence of common grade 3/4 AEs with daratumumab were <7% apart from neutropenia, lymphopenia and pneumonia (45.9 vs. 32.3, 13 vs. 7.5, and 10.6 vs.7.2)(Table 3). Grade 3/4 daratumumab infusion related reactions happened in 3.8% CONCLUSIONS These results from an integrated analysis support a favorable benefit/risk profile of daratumumab in patients with MM.

AB  - Background: Patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) after failure of standard-of-care immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs; eg, lenalidomide) and proteasome inhibitors (PIs) experience poor outcomes and have been underrepresented in contemporary clinical trials. Triplet therapies, including those incorporating the monoclonal antibodies elotuzumab or daratumumab with pomalidomide plus dexamethasone (EPd/DPd) or the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat with bortezomib plus dexamethasone (PanoVd), have demonstrated efficacy in pts with RRMM after ≥2 prior lines of therapy (LoTs), including lenalidomide and/or a PI. However, without head-to-head randomized trials, and as direct cross-trial comparisons of specific regimens are not possible due to differing study designs and pt populations, the relative benefits of different treatments are difficult to distinguish. Therefore, additional data to guide treatment decisions are needed. Aims: To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) benefit of EPd relative to PanoVd or DPd in pts with RRMM. Methods: Unanchored MAIC analyses were performed using previously described methodology to minimize the heterogeneity of baseline characteristics in pt populations between trials (Signorovitch 2010). Individual pt data (IPD) from pts receiving EPd in ELOQUENT-3 (NCT02654132, database lock Feb 2018) were reweighted to match the most relevant prognostic baseline characteristics that were available for single-arm trials of PanoVd (NCT01083602; PANORAMA-2) and DPd (NCT01998971; EQUULEUS). PFS was then compared across balanced trial populations and assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves with hazard ratios (HRs) generated via Cox regression. Differences in the area under the curve (DAUC) from best-fitting parametric curves were used to compare the mean PFS at key landmark timepoints between groups; confidence intervals (CIs) for AUC estimates were generated using Monte Carlo simulations. Results: Pts refractory to bortezomib from the EPd arm of ELOQUENT-3 (unmatched n = 38) were matched to those receiving PanoVd (n = 55) on the basis of high-risk disease, time since diagnosis, and prior stem cell transplantation (EPd matched effective sample size = 33). Daratumumab-naive pts from the EPd arm of ELOQUENT-3 (unmatched n = 59) were matched to pts receiving DPd in EQUULEUS (n = 103) on the basis of high-risk disease, refractoriness to both IMiDs and PIs, and number of prior LoTs (EPd matched effective sample size = 54). After matching, MAIC analysis of EPd versus PanoVd demonstrated statistically significant superiority in median PFS (10.3 vs 5.4 mo; HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25- 0.75; p = 0.003; Figure). The mean PFS at 5 y was estimated to be 10.4 mo for EPd and 7.2 mo for PanoVd, with DAUC of 3.2 (95% CI -2.3 to 39.9) mo. After matching, median PFS was similar for EPd versus DPd (10.3 vs 9.9 mo; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.59-1.47; p = 0.75). The mean PFS at 5 y was estimated to be 19.9 mo for EPd and 18.3 mo for DPd, with DAUC of 1.6 (95% CI -6.8 to 9.9) mo. Sensitivity analyses matching fewer or more covariates gave generally similar results when comparing median PFS. Summary/Conclusion: This MAIC analysis of triplet-based regimens for RRMM suggests that EPd was associated with superior PFS versus PanoVd and similar PFS versus DPd. This statistical analysis is limited by small sample sizes but provides further information on treatment choices for RRMM after prior treatment with an IMiD and/or a PI. (Figure Presented) .

AB  - Introduction: Bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (VTd) is a standard-of-care regimen in Europe for patients (pts) with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who are transplant eligible. The combination of daratumumab (DARA), a CD38-targeted mAb, with VTd significantly reduced the risk of progression or death and improved stringent complete response (sCR), CR or better (≥CR), and minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative rates vs VTd alone in transplant-eligible NDMM pts in Part 1 of the phase 3 CASSIOPEIA study. Part 2 is ongoing. MRD status is emerging as a valuable prognostic tool to evaluate efficacy in MM. The development of multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques has enabled more sensitive and high-throughput detection of MRD. Here, we evaluated the concordance in post-consolidation MRD results between the MFC and NGS methodologies from Part 1 of CASSIOPEIA. Methods: Transplant-eligible NDMM pts were randomized 1:1 to 4 pre-ASCT induction and 2 post-ASCT consolidation cycles with D-VTd or VTd. MRD analyses were performed on bone marrow aspirates post-induction and post-consolidation (at Day 100 post-ASCT) in all pts, regardless of response. For the ITT population, any missing or indeterminate results were assumed to be MRD positive. MRD was assessed primarily by EuroFlow-based MFC (with multi-epitope CD38 mAb to mitigate DARA interference) and, based on sample availability, secondarily with NGS (Adaptive clonoSEQ® Assay). Here, we evaluated the concordance in the subset of pts tested by both assays at a standard threshold of 10ˆ–5. Results: A cohort of 1,085 pts was randomized to D-VTd (n = 543) or VTd (n = 542). There were 346 pts (63.7%) in the D-VTd group versus 236 (43.5%; P <0.0001) in the VTd group who achieved post-consolidation MRD negativity by MFC (ITT population) and 210 pts (56.6%) vs 134 (36.8%; P <0.0001) who achieved post-consolidation MRD negativity by NGS (MRD-evaluable population). A total of 733 pts were evaluable by both MFC and NGS post-consolidation. Evaluation of concordance between MFC and NGS MRD results, regardless of response, showed good overall agreement (83.5%). Considering response of ≥CR, analysis of concordance between MFC+≥CR vs NGS+≥CR status showed minimal difference in evaluating MRD by either method (94.4% agreement). Additionally, the overall agreement between MFC and NGS by treatment group was similar between the 2 cohorts (82.7% for D-VTd vs 84.3% for VTd). Conclusions: The high overall concordance of MRD results (10ˆ–5) by MFC and NGS, regardless of response and combined with pts achieving CR or better, indicates that both techniques performed similarly in evaluating MRD. Moreover, the agreement between MRD assessments was similar between the D-VTd and VTd cohorts, suggesting that the presence of DARA did not interfere with MRD evaluation by the MFC protocol used.

AB  - Introduction: Daratumumab (DARA) is a human monoclonal IgG1κ CD38 antibody that functions through multifaceted mechanisms of action, including CDC, ADCC, ADCP, induction of apoptosis and immunomodulatory activity (Krejcik et al, Blood 2016;128:384-394). DARA was added to standard of care (SOC) regimens in two randomized, controlled, phase 3 trials in RRMM: POLLUX (DARA+lenalidomide/dexamethasone [DRd] vs lenalidomide/dexamethasone [Rd]) and CASTOR (DARA+bortezomib/dexamethasone [DVd] vs bortezomib/dexamethasone [Vd]). The addition of DARA to these regimens resulted in significant improvements in PFS (hazard ratio for PFS: 0.37 and 0.39 for POLLUX and CASTOR, respectively) and ORR (POLLUX: 93% DRd vs 76% Rd; CASTOR: 83% DVd vs 63% Vd) (Dimopoulos MA et al, N Engl J Med 2016; in press; Palumbo A et al, N Engl J Med 2016; in press). To determine the ability of DARA to drive deep clinical responses beyond complete response (CR), MRD was assessed in both POLLUX and CASTOR using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of B cell receptor (Ig). This is the first comprehensive and prospective study of MRD to date in randomized phase 3 clinical trials of RRMM patients and investigates the ability of DARA-containing regimens to drive deep responses in this challenging population. Methods: MRD was assessed in POLLUX (blinded to treatment group) at the time of suspected CR, and at 3 and 6 months post-suspected CR for patients who maintained this response. Similarly, in CASTOR, MRD was assessed for patients at the time of suspected CR (blinded to treatment group) and at 6 months and 12 months after first dose (at the end and 6 months after end of Vd background therapy, respectively). MRD was assessed on bone marrow aspirate samples prepared using Ficoll and evaluated by the ClonoSEQ assay (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA, USA) at sensitivities of 0.01% (1 cancer cell per 10,000 nucleated cells or 10 ), 0.001% (10 ), and 0.0001% (10 ). The MRD negative rate per treatment arm was determined as the proportion of patients with negative MRD at any time point after the first dose and compared using the likelihood-ratio test. To allow for a stringent, unbiased evaluation of MRD in these studies, the entire intent-to-treat population was evaluated where patients were considered MRD positive if they had only MRD positive test result or had no MRD assessment. In POLLUX, 63% in DRd and 87% in Rd did not receive a MRD assessment, and for CASTOR, 76% in DVd and 87% in Vd were not assessed for MRD. Results: Median duration of follow-up was 13.5 months and 7.4 months in POLLUX and CASTOR, respectively. The addition of DARA to SOC regimens (Rd in POLLUX or Vd in CASTOR) resulted in significantly higher MRD negative rates at all three thresholds examined (10 , 10 , and 10 ; Table). Additionally, patients who achieved MRD negative status experienced fewer PFS events compared with MRD positive patients at a threshold of 10 (Figure). Among pts who achieved CR or better, the rate of MRD negativity was at least 3-fold higher across all sensitivity thresholds in the DARA + SOC treatment groups compared with SOC alone. In MRD positive patients, PFS was significantly longer in the DARA + SOC treatment groups compared with SOC alone treatment arms. Updated data from both studies will be presented at the annual meeting. Conclusion: These two studies represent the first randomized, controlled, prospective evaluation of MRD in the RRMM phase 3 clinical trial setting and demonstrate that DARAcontaining therapies are able to drive patients to remarkably deep levels of clinical response. Regardless of the SOC component, DARA-containing regimens consistently demonstrated ≥3- fold increase in MRD negative rate compared with the control groups at all evaluated thresholds. Importantly, since patients who achieved MRD negative status demonstrated low PFS event rates, the deep clinical responses induced by DARA may lead to improved survival. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Background: In TE NDMM patients (pts), the CD38 monoclonal antibody DARA significantly reduced the risk of progression/death and improved stringent CR, ≥CR, and MRD-negative rates when added to VTd in the phase 3 CASSIOPEIA study. MRD status and its association with progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated in TE NDMM pts receiving D-VTd vs VTd as pre-transplant induction/post-transplant consolidation in Part 1 of CASSIOPEIA. Methods: In Part 1, TE NDMM pts were randomized 1:1 to 4 cycles of pre-ASCT induction and 2 cycles of post-ASCT consolidation with DARA + VTd or VTd. Landmark analyses of MRD were performed on bone marrow aspirates after induction by multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC; 10-5sensitivity threshold) and after consolidation (at Day 100 post-ASCT) by MFC (10-5) and next-generation sequencing (NGS; 10-6) for all pts, regardless of response. Results: A cohort of 1085 pts was randomized (D-VTd, n = 543; VTd, n = 542). Post-induction and post-consolidation MRD-negative rates were significantly higher for D-VTd vs VTd (Table). Post-consolidation MRD-negative rates (MFC) were consistent across pt subgroups, including ISS stage III or high-risk cytogenetics. Multivariate analyses accounting for treatment arm and MRD negativity (MFC) showed a PFS benefit in pts reaching MRD negativity (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.20-0.50; P <0.0001). Based on these analyses, D-VTd showed additional PFS benefit vs VTd (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30-0.78; P = 0.0028). Analysis of MRD based on response (per IMWG criteria) will be presented. Conclusions: Adding DARA to VTd induction and consolidation deepened responses, as demonstrated by significant increases in MRD-negative rates. MRD negativity was associated with a PFS benefit regardless of treatment group. However, deepened responses with D-VTd led to improved outcomes, with MRD negativity associated with prolonged PFS, versus VTd in pts with TE NDMM.

AB  - Introduction: Daratumumab (DARA) is a human, CD38-targeted, IgG1κ monoclonal antibody approved as monotherapy in heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) and in combination with standard-of-care regimens for transplant-ineligible NDMM and RRMM. The addition of DARA to standard-of-care regimens in phase 3 studies has consistently demonstrated a near doubling of complete response (CR) rates, tripling of minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity rates, and reduction in the risk of disease progression or death by ≥44% in patients with transplantineligible NDMM or RRMM. In the primary analysis of the phase 3 MAIA study (median follow-up: 28.0 months), a significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit (median not reached [NR] vs 31.9 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; P<0.001) and a >3-fold increase in MRD-negativity rates (10-5 sensitivity threshold; 24.2% vs 7.3%; P<0.001) were observed for D-Rd vs Rd in patients with transplant-ineligible NDMM (Facon T, N Engl J Med 2019). Here, we report updated efficacy and safety findings from MAIA after 9 months of additional follow-up. Methods: Patients with NDMM ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation due to age ≥65 years or comorbidities were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive Rd ± DARA. Stratification factors included International Staging System stage (ISS [I vs II vs III]), region (North America vs other), and age (<75 vs ≥75 years). All patients received 28-day cycles of Rd (R: 25 mg orally once daily on Days 1-21; d: 40 mg orally on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22). In the D-Rd arm, DARA (16 mg/kg intravenously) was given weekly for Cycles 1-2, bi-weekly for Cycles 3-6, and every 4 weeks thereafter. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity in both treatment arms. The primary endpoint was PFS. Key secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), MRD-negativity rate (10-5 sensitivity, clonoSEQ® version 2.0), and safety. PFS on the next line of therapy (PFS2), defined as the time from randomization to progression on the next line of therapy or death, was also measured. Results: A total of 737 patients were randomized (D-Rd, N = 368; Rd, N = 369). Patient baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment arms. Median (range) age was 73 (45- 90) years, with 44% of patients ≥75 years of age. 27%, 43%, and 29% of all patients were ISS stage I, II, and III, respectively. Among 642 patients evaluable for FISH/karyotyping analysis, 86% had standard and 14% had high cytogenetic risk. After a median follow-up of 36.4 months, median PFS was NR with D-Rd vs 33.8 months with Rd (HR, 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.71; P<0.0001; Figure). The estimated 36-month PFS rate was 68% with D-Rd vs 46% with Rd. The PFS benefit of D-Rd vs Rd was observed in all prespecified subgroups, except for patients with impaired hepatic function. Adding DARA to Rd continued to result in deeper responses with higher rates of ≥CR and ≥very good partial response (VGPR; Table). Median duration of response among responders was NR with D-Rd vs 40.7 months with Rd. Median PFS2 was NR vs 47.3 months with D-Rd vs Rd, respectively (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53- 0.91; P=0.0079); follow up is ongoing. 143 (39%) vs 233 (64%) patients with D-Rd vs Rd, respectively, have discontinued treatment. 85 (23%) patients with D-Rd vs 103 (28%) patients with Rd have discontinued the study due to death. Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; D-Rd/Rd) occurring in ≥10% of patients were neutropenia (51%/35%), lymphopenia (15%/11%), pneumonia (15%/9%), anemia (14%/21%), leukopenia (11%/6%), and hypokalemia (10%/10%); grade 3/4 infection rates were 36%/27%. The most common serious TEAE was pneumonia (14%/9%). 9% of patients in the D-Rd arm and 18% of patients in the Rd arm discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. The complete updated data set will be presented at the meeting with additional efficacy endpoints, including MRD-negativity rate. Conclusion: After longer follow up, the addition of DARA d continues to demonstrate a significant PFS benefit and improved rates of deeper and more durable responses vs Rd alone in patients with transplant-ineligible NDMM. The longer follow-up also demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS2 favoring D-Rd, and no new safety concerns were observed. These results continue to support the use of D-Rd in the first line of treatment for transplant-ineligible patients with NDMM. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Background: Daratumumab is a human IgGκ monoclonal antibody targeting CD38 with a direct ontumor and immunomodulatory mechanism of action. The intravenous (IV) formulation of daratumumab is approved in many countries for use as monotherapy in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), and in combination with standard-of-care regimens in RRMM and patients with NDMM who are transplant ineligible. A subcutaneous (SC) formulation of daratumumab is currently under investigation in several ongoing studies. In the phase 3 COLUMBA study, daratumumab SC was shown to be non-inferior to daratumumab IV, demonstrating similar efficacy and pharmacokinetics, with a significantly decreased rate of infusion-related reactions and reduced administration time. The randomized phase 2 LYNX (MMY2065) study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of retreatment with subcutaneous daratumumab in patients with RRMM who were previously exposed to daratumumab IV therapy. Study Design and Methods: In this ongoing, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 2 study, approximately 230 patients with prior exposure to daratumumab will be randomized 1:1 to receive daratumumab plus carfilzomib and dexamethasone (D-Kd) or carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) alone. Patients must have received 1 to 2 prior lines of therapy (at least one of which included daratumumab IV) with the daratumumab-based therapy completed ≥3 months prior to randomization. Eligible patients must have achieved a partial response or better (as defined by International Myeloma Working Group [IMWG] criteria) to daratumumab-based therapy, with a duration of response of ≥4 months. Patients must not have discontinued daratumumab due to a daratumumab-related adverse event or received prior treatment with carfilzomib. All patients will receive 20 mg/m2 carfilzomib IV on Day 1 of Cycle 1, escalated to 70 mg/m2 on Days 8 and 15; carfilzomib 70 mg/m2 will be administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle thereafter. Dexamethasone 40 mg will be administered (IV or PO) QW for Cycles 1-9 and then on Days 1, 8, and 15 from Cycle 10 onwards. Patients in the D-Kd group will also receive daratumumab SC (1,800 mg co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 [rHuPH20; 2,000 U/mL; ENHANZE® drug delivery technology, Halozyme, Inc.]) QW in Cycles 1-2, Q2W in Cycles 3-6, and Q4W thereafter. The primary endpoint is the rate of patients achieving a very good partial response or better. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate, rate of patients achieving complete response or better, progression-free survival, overall survival, overall MRD-negativity rate, time to next treatment, pharmacokinetics, and safety. The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier is NCT03871829.

AB  - Background: Daratumumab (D) is a human CD38-targeting mAb that significantly prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) when added to standard-of-care regimens in patients (pts) with RRMM. We examined updated efficacy and safety data from POLLUX (NCT02076009), a randomized phase 3 study of DRd vs Rd in RRMM. Methods: Pts with ≥1 prior line of therapy (LOT) received Rd (25 mg PO lenalidomide on days 1-21 of each q4w cycle; 40 mg dexamethasone weekly) ± D (16 mg/kg IV qw for cycles 1 and 2, q2w for cycles 3-6, then q4w until disease progression). Pts refractory to lenalidomide were ineligible. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed on bone marrow samples at time of suspected complete response (CR) and at 3 and 6 months post-suspected CR at sensitivities of 10 , 10 , and 10 via next-generation sequencing (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA). Results: Pts received a median (range) of 1 (1-11) prior LOT. 55% received prior IMiDs (18% lenalidomide). Based on previous median follow-up of 17.3 months, DRd significantly prolonged PFS (median: not reached vs 17.5 months; HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.28-0.50; P< 0.0001) and significantly improved overall response rate (ORR; 93% vs 76%, P< 0.0001) vs Rd. DRd induced higher rates of deep responses vs Rd (≥very good partial response [VGPR]: 78% vs 45%; ≥CR: 46% vs 20%; all P< 0.0001) and included MRD negativity, which was > 3-fold higher across all 3 sensitivity thresholds for DRd vs Rd (25% vs 6% at the 10 threshold). MRD-negative pts demonstrated longer PFS vs MRD-positive pts. Follow up for overall survival (OS) is ongoing (OS events: 40 [14%] in DRd and 56 [20%] in Rd). No new safety signals were identified with longer follow up. Updated efficacy and safety data based on approximately 25-months follow up will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: DRd provided significant benefits vs Rd in terms of PFS, ORR, and MRD negativity, and the favorable safety proffle of DRd was maintained with longer follow up. These data further validate the use of DRd in RRMM pts who received ≥1 prior therapy.

AB  - On November 21, 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted regular approval to daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. Approval was based on two randomized, open-label trials in which daratumumab was added to these backbone therapies. The MMY3003 trial demonstrated substantial improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) when daratumumab was added to lenalidomide and dexamethasone compared with lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone. The estimated median PFS had not been reached in the daratumumab arm and was 18.4 months in the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27-0.52; p < .0001), representing a 63% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death. Similar results were observed in the MMY3004 trial comparing the combination of daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone with bortezomib and dexamethasone. The estimated median PFS was not reached in the daratumumab arm and was 7.2 months in the control arm (HR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.28-0.53; p < .0001), representing a 61% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 20%) in MMY3003 were infusion reactions, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, muscle spasm, cough, and dyspnea. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 20%) in MMY3004 were infusion reactions, diarrhea, peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, and peripheral sensory neuropathy. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia have been added to the Warnings and Precautions of the drug label. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Daratumumab, the first monoclonal antibody targeted against CD38, received U.S. Food and Drug Administration accelerated approval in 2015 based on data from single-agent, single-arm trials that provided response rate information. Results of the MMY3003 and MMY3004 trials established that daratumumab can be combined synergistically with some of the most highly active agents used to treat multiple myeloma, leading to daratumumab's regular approval in 2016. Daratumumab added to lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, provides a substantial improvement in progression-free survival in previously treated patients with multiple myeloma. These combinations will likely improve the survival outlook for patients with multiple myeloma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Four new agents (elotuzumab, ixazomib, panobinostat, and daratumumab) were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2015 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Our objective was to compare the safety profiles of these new medications in real-world settings and their randomized controlled trial(s). MATERIAL AND METHODS: An analysis was conducted of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) for each drug consisting of the quarter that the drug received its FDA approval and the eight subsequent quarters. Reporting odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were then calculated for each drug for each of the 10 most frequent adverse drug reactions. The randomized controlled trials that led to initial FDA approval for these medications were subsequently reviewed to assess the 10 most frequently reported adverse drug reactions in these trials. RESULTS: There were only two adverse drug reactions in the top 10 of both FAERS and its randomized controlled trials for elotuzumab (anaemia, diarrhoea) and for daratumumab (cough, back pain), five for ixazomib (diarrhoea, constipation, fatigue, nausea, peripheral neuropathy), and four panobinostat (diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea, constipation). Ixazomib had two adverse drug reactions with a significant reporting odds ratios greater than a 10-fold increased risk (plasma cell myeloma, peripheral neuropathy); elotuzumab had three adverse drug reactions (infusion site reaction, malignant neoplasm progression, deep vein thrombosis); daratumumab had three adverse drug reactions (infusion site reaction, bronchospasm, chills), while panobinostat had four (malignant neoplasm progression, decreased platelet count, diarrhoea, increased blood creatinine). CONCLUSION: This analysis helps to highlight the importance of conducting postmarketing pharmacovigilance studies to better understand the potential adverse reactions of these medications.

AB  - Introduction: In the phase 3 ALCYONE study, daratumumab (D) in combination with VMP (D-VMP) prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) vs VMP alone, and exhibited favorable tolerability in pts with NDMM. We conducted a subgroup analysis of the efficacy and safety of D-VMP vs VMP according to baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl; ≤60 mL/min [moderately impaired] and >60 mL/min). Methods: Randomized pts were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy with ASCT and had baseline CrCl ≥40 mL/min. Up to nine 6-week VMP cycles (V 1.3 mg/m2 SC on Days [d] 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, 32 in Cycle [C] 1 and d 1, 8, 22, 29 in C 2-9; M 9 mg/m2 PO and P 60 mg/m2 PO on d 1-4 in C 1-9) with or without D (16 mg/kg IV QW for C1, Q3W for C 2-9, and Q4W for C 10+ [post VMP-treatment phase] until progression) were received. Minimal residual disease (MRD) at 10-5 threshold was evaluated using clonoSEQ® (Adaptive Biotechnologies). Results: Among 706 (350 D-VMP; 356 VMP) randomized pts, 295 (150 D-VMP; 145 VMP) had baseline CrCl ≤60 mL/min (≤60) and 411 (200 D-VMP; 211 VMP) had baseline CrCl >60 mL/min (>60). D-VMP prolonged PFS vs VMP in ≤60 (median not reached [NR] vs 16.9 mo; HR 0.36; 95% CI 0.24-0.56) and >60 (median NR vs 18.3 mo; HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.45-0.88) subgroups after median follow-up of 16.5 mo. ORR benefit was maintained for D-VMP vs VMP in the ≤60 (89% vs 73%; ≥complete response [CR]: 43% vs 24%) and >60 (92% vs 74%; ≥CR: 43% vs 25%) subgroups; similar findings were observed with MRD-negative rates in the ≤60 (25% vs 8%; odds ratio [OR] 4.13; 95% CI 2.02-8.46) and >60 (20% vs 5%; OR 4.55; 95% CI 2.26-9.14) subgroups. For D-VMP vs VMP, grade 3/4 neutropenia was 47% vs 38% in the ≤60 subgroup and 35% vs 39% in the >60 subgroup. Additionally, grade 3/4 peripheral sensory neuropathy was 2% vs 4% in the ≤60 subgroup and 1% vs 4% in the >60 subgroup. In the ≤60 and >60 subgroups, infusion reactions were observed in 27% (Grade 3/4: 5%/0.7%) and 29% (Grade 3/4: 4%/0.5%), respectively. Conclusions: D plus VMP prolongs PFS, induces deep responses, and demonstrates acceptable tolerability regardless of baseline CrCl. NCT02195479.

AB  - Introduction: Daratumumab (D) plus VMP (D-VMP) prolonged progression- free survival (PFS) compared with VMP and was well-tolerated in the phase 3 ALCYONE study (NCT02195479). We examined the efficacy and safety profiles of D-VMP vs VMP in elderly (≥75 y) and non-elderly (< 75 y) NDMM pts in ALCYONE. Methods: Pts were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy with ASCT. Pts received up to nine 6-week VMP cycles (V: 1.3 mg/m2 SC Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, 32 [Cycle 1] and Days 1, 8, 22, 29 [Cycles 2-9]; M: 9 mg/m2 PO and P: 60 mg/m2 PO Days 1-4 [Cycles 1-9]) ± D (16 mg/kg IV QW for Cycle 1, Q3W for Cycles 2-9, and Q4W for Cycles 10+ [post VMP-treatment phase] until progression). Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed by clonoSEQ® assay (Adaptive Biotechnologies). Results: 706 (350 D-VMP; 356 VMP) pts were randomized, including 211 ≥75 y (104 D-VMP; 107 VMP) and 495 < 75 y (246 D-VMP; 249 VMP) pts. For D-VMP vs VMP, the median duration of study treatment was 14.5 mo vs 12.0 mo for ≥75 y pts and 15.0 mo vs 12.0 mo for < 75 y pts, respectively. After median follow-up of 16.5 months, PFS was prolonged with D-VMP vs VMP in both the ≥75 y (median not reached [NR] vs 20.4 mo; HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.32-0.85) and < 75 y (median NR vs 17.9 mo; HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.36-0.68) pts. ORR and ≥complete response (CR) rates were consistently higher for D-VMP vs VMP in ≥75 y (ORR: 88% vs 70%; ≥CR: 41% vs 24%) and < 75 y (ORR: 92% vs 76%; ≥CR: 43% vs 25%) pts. MRD-negative rates (10-5 threshold) also increased with D-VMP vs VMP in ≥75 y (24% vs 8%) and < 75 y (22% vs 6%) pts. For D-VMP vs VMP, rates of grade 3/4 neutropenia were 52% vs 42% in ≥75 y pts and 35% vs 38% in < 75 y pts. Grade 3/4 peripheral sensory neuropathy (≥75 y: 0% vs 6%; < 75 y: 2% vs 3%) and grade 3/4 infections (≥75 y: 28% vs 20%; < 75 y: 21% vs 13%) were observed. D-associated infusion-related reactions were 36% (9% grade 3/4) in ≥75 y and 24% (3% grade 3/4) in < 75 y pts. Conclusions: Efficacy and safety of D-VMP vs VMP in pts ≥75 y of age were consistent with the overall study population.

AB  - Introduction: Daratumumab is a human CD38 IgGκ monoclonal antibody that demonstrated significant activity and a manageable safety profile in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. In a randomized phase 3 study, daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd) significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus bortezomib and dexamethasone alone (Vd) in a pre-specified interim analysis of patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM; Palumbo A. N Engl J Med 2016; in press). Herein, we examine subgroups from this study to compare the efficacy of DVd vs Vd in bortezomib-naive and bortezomib-experienced pt populations. In addition, the efficacy of DVd vs Vd in pts who were refractory to lenalidomide at last prior line of therapy was also evaluated. Methods: Pts who received ≥1 prior line of therapy were randomized (1:1) to 8 cycles (q3w) of Vd (bortezomib: 1.3 mg/m2 SC on Days 1, 4, 8, 11; dexamethasone: 20 mg PO on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12) with or without daratumumab (16 mg/kg IV qw in Cycles 1-3, Day 1 of Cycles 4-8, then q4w until progression). Pts who were refractory to bortezomib were not eligible. The primary endpoint was PFS. Bone marrow aspirate samples that had been prepared with Ficoll were evaluated for minimal residual disease (MRD) using three different thresholds (10-4, 10-5, and 10-6) based on the ClonoSEQ assay (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA, USA). Results: Median follow-up was 7.4 months. Among bortezomib-naive pts (DVd, n=89; Vd, n=83), PFS was significantly improved with DVd vs Vd (median: not reached [NR] vs 7.5 months; HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.13-0.47; P<0.0001); estimated 12-month PFS rates were 72% vs 28%, respectively. ORR was 88% with DVd vs 70% with Vd (P=0.0040), with ≥very good partial response (VGPR) rates of 72% vs 42% (P<0.0001), and ≥complete response (CR) rates of 30% vs 20% (P=0.1199), respectively. For pts who previously received a bortezomib-containing regimen (DVd, n=162; Vd, n=164), PFS was also significantly longer with DVd vs Vd (median: 12.3 vs 6.7 months; HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.32-0.66; P<0.0001). Estimated 12-month PFS rates were 55% vs 27%, respectively. ORR was significantly higher with DVd vs Vd (80% vs 60%; P=0.0001), along with significantly higher rates of ≥VGPR (52% vs 22%; P<0.0001) and ≥CR (13% vs 3%; P=0.0019). Among pts who were refractory to lenalidomide at the last prior line of therapy (DVd, n=45; Vd, n=60), PFS was significantly longer in DVd vs Vd (median: 10.3 vs 4.4 mo; HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.21-0.65; P=0.0004; Figure). Within this subgroup, ORR was significantly higher for DVd vs Vd (81% vs 50%; P=0.0021), and the same trends were observed for rates of ≥VGPR (54% vs 12%; P<0.0001) and ≥CR (20% vs 5%; P=0.0261). Updated efficacy and safety data, including MRD analyses across different sensitivity thresholds (10-4, 10-5, and 10-6), will be presented at the meeting. Conclusio ns: These analyses confirm that addition of daratumumab to Vd significantly improves outcomes for RRMM pts regardless of prior treatment with bortezomib. Importantly, this treatment benefit of DVd vs Vd was maintained in pts who were refractory to lenalidomide at the last prior line of therapy. These data lend further support to adding daratumumab to a standard-of-care regimen in RRMM.

AB  - Purpose of the Study: Daratumumab (DARA), a human CD38 mAb, is approved as monotherapy and in combination with standard-of-care (SoC) regimens for MM. In phase 3 studies, DARA-based regimens improved response rates, depth of response including stringent complete response (sCR) and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity, and progression-free survival (PFS). In autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)-eligible NDMM patients, RVd followed by high-dose therapy (HDT), ASCT, and consolidation is SoC in the US. GRIFFIN is a phase 2, randomized, active controlled, US study of DARA plus RVd (D-RVd) in ASCT-eligible NDMM patients. A safety run-in showed no safety concerns. Here we present the primary analysis of the randomized portion of GRIFFIN. Summarized Description of the Project: Patients were randomized 1:1 to RVd ± DARA, stratified by ISS stage and creatinine clearance. Patients received 4 induction cycles, stem cell mobilization, HDT, ASCT, 2 consolidation cycles, and maintenance with R ± DARA for 24 months. During induction/consolidation (Cycles [C] 16), patients received V 1.3 mg/m2 SC on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11; R 25 mg PO on Days 114; and d 40 mg QW every 21 days. DARA 16 mg/kg IV was administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of C14 and on Day 1 of C56. During maintenance (C7-32), patients received R 10 mg (15 mg in C10+ if tolerated) on Days 121 every 28 days ± DARA 16 mg/kg IV Q8W (or Q4W per patient decision after Amendment 2). The primary endpoint was the sCR rate by the end of consolidation per IMWG computer algorithm. The study had 80% power to detect a 15% improvement with a 1-sided alpha of 0.1 (equivalent to 2-sided alpha of 0.2). Results: A total of 207 patients were randomized. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between arms. Median (range) age was 60 (29-70) years, and 48%, 37%, and 14% of patients were ISS stage I, II, and III, respectively. The study met its primary endpoint; D-RVd improved the sCR rate by end of consolidation (42.4% vs 32.0%; odds ratio 1.57; 95% CI, 0.87-2.82; P=0.1359) at the pre-set 2-sided alpha of 0.2. D-RVd achieved higher overall response (99% vs 92%), VGPR (91% vs 73%), and CR (52% vs 42%) rates vs RVd. The rate of MRD negativity (10^5 NGS) among patients achieving CR was higher with D-RVd (59% vs 24%). At median follow-up of 13.5 months, duration of response, PFS, and OS data are immature. Median stem cell yield was 8.1 vs 9.4 × 106 cells/kg for D-RVd vs RVd. Grade 3/4 TEAEs (10%) included neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. There was no difference in the rate of grade 3/4 infections between arms. Infusion reactions occurred in 41% of DARA-treated patients (mainly grade 1-2 and with the first infusion). Conclusion: D-RVd induces higher response rates and greater depth of response, including sCR and MRD negativity, than RVd. The overall safety profile of D-RVd is consistent with previous reports of DARA and RVd, and stem cell mobilization and ASCT are feasible with DRVd. Assessment of the effect of DARA maintenance on sCR improvement and MRD rates is ongoing.

AB  - Introduction: Daratumumab (DARA) is a human monoclonal IgG1 κ CD38-targeting antibody that functions through several mechanisms of action (MOA), including CDC, ADCC, ADCP and induction of apoptosis. An additional, novel role of immune modulation and increased adaptive immune response was revealed from translational studies of DARA (16 mg/kg) in single-agent, phase 1/2 studies (SIRIUS [MMY2002] and GEN501; Krejcik J et al, Blood 2016;128:384-94). To further explore the ability of DARA to promote adaptive T-cell responses, we profiled T-cell repertoires (TCR) to eValuate T-cell clonality, expansion, and diversity from samples collected in POLLUX (MMY3003), a phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study for patients with relapsed/refractory MM, in which DARA was tested in combination with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone versus lenalidomide plus dexamethasone alone (DRd vs. Rd; Dimopoulos MA et al, N Engl J Med 2016; in press). Methods: T-cell receptor beta (TCRβ) sequencing for repertoire profiling was conducted on whole blood samples collected at baseline and eight weeks after DARA treatment (cycle 3 [C3]) from subjects on both arms using the ImmunoSEQ assay (Adaptive Biotechnologies. Seattle, WA, USA). 133 subjects in DRd and 124 subjects in Rd treatment groups were included in this analysis and represented a balanced subgroup of the POLLUX clinical trial subjects. T-cell metric changes were compared between arms with ANOVa, including the treatment arm and visit interaction term. Within treatment-arm changes were eValuated with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test comparing baseline to on-treatment Values per patient. Results: Consistent with the randomized treatment groups, no baseline differences were observed in T-cell repertoire metrics between the treatment arms, including T-cell clonality, diversity (or richness), and T-cell fraction. Similar to prior findings from DARA monotherapy studies, significantly larger increase of TCRβ clonality was observed in the DRd arm (median of 0.166 at baseline to 0.263 at C3). Interestingly, there was no increase in TCRβ clonality in the Rd arm (median of 0.175 at baseline to 0.175 at C3). The change in TCRβ clonality between C1 and C3 was significantly different between DRd and Rd (p=3.26E-10), demonstrating that the addition of DARA to Rd induces a specific clonal expansion of T cells. Estimated richness (diversity), on the other hand, slightly decreased with DRd treatment but not with Rd treatment (median of 503, 951 at baseline to 427, 096 at C3 [p= 1.01E-04] vs 572, 182 to 532, 806 [p= 3.58-01]). Among patients in both treatment groups, a bigger increase in T-cell fraction was observed in DRd vs Rd (median of 0.231 at baseline to 0.278 at C3 [p= 2.62E-3] vs 0.228 to 0.249 [p= 1.91E-01]). Although there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics in T-cell clonality, richness, and T-cell fraction, quartile analysis demonstrated that high baseline TCR richness predicted for better PFS with DRd but not for Rd. Conclusion: DARA in combination with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone specifically induced robust increases in T-cell clonality, which was not observed within the control lenalidomide plus dexamethasone arm. Interestingly, baseline TCR richness was associated with improved PFS in DRd subjects. This obserVation is similar to results with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Postow MA et al, J Immunother Cancer 2015;3:23), and together with the significant increase in T-cell clonality, provides further evidence for the immunomodulatory activity of DARA, even in combination therapy. These data support DARA's immune-modulatory MOA and provide additional insights into DARA's effect on the TCR in combination with standard of care treatment.

AB  - DARAtumumab (DARA) is approved in combination with standardof-care for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) and relapsed or refractory MM (RRMM). In phase 3 studies, DARAbased regimens reduced the risk of progression or death and increased rates of ≥ complete response (CR) and minimal residual disease negativity in patients with NDMM and RRMM. In the POLLUX study (median follow-up 44.3 months), DARA plus lenalinomide and dexamethasone (D-Rd) reduced the risk of disease progression or death and significantly increased the overall response rate (ORR) versus Rd in patients with RRMM. Here, we present POLLUX efficacy and safety analyses after median follow-up of >4 years. Patients with ≥1 prior line of therapy (LOT) were randomized to Rd . DARA. Patients with high cytogenetic risk had t(4;14), t (14;16), and del17p abnormalities. Progression-free survival (PFS) on subsequent LOT (PFS2) was defined as time from randomization to progression after next LOT or death. A total of 569 patients were randomized (D-Rd, n = 286; Rd, n = 283). At median follow-up 54.8 months, D-Rd prolonged PFS vs. Rd [median 45.0 vs. 17.5 months; hazard ratio (HR), 0.44; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.35-0.54; P < 0.0001], and prolonged PFS vs. Rd regardless of prior LOT or cytogenetic risk status. D-Rd was associated with a higher ORR vs. Rd (93% vs 80%) and higher ≥ very good partial response and ≥ CR. D-Rd prolonged time to next LOT vs. Rd (median: not reached vs. 22.8 months; HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.30-0.48; P < 0.0001) and prolonged PFS2 vs. Rd (median 53.3 vs. 31.6 months; HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.42-0.66; P < 0.0001). A total of 125 deaths were observed with D-Rd vs. 144 with Rd; overall survival (OS) follow-up is ongoing. Median treatment duration was 34.3 months with D-Rd vs. 16.0 months with Rd. The most common (≥10%) grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events with DRd vs. Rd were neutropenia (57% vs. 42%), anaemia (19% vs. 22%), thrombocytopenia (15% vs. 16%), pneumonia (16% vs. 10%) and diarrhoea (10% vs. 4%). Additional efficacy and safety data will be presented. After a median follow-up of >4 years, D-Rd continued to show a significant PFS benefit and higher ORRs and deep response rates versus Rd in patients with RRMM. Significant PFS benefit was seen with D-Rd regardless of prior LOT or cytogenetic risk status; greatest benefit was seen in patients treated earlier with D-Rd. Significant PFS2 improvement suggests a potential survival benefit, but OS data are still immature. No new safety concerns were identified. Study Support: Janssen.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide and bortezomib frontline exposure has raised a growing need for novel treatments for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Carfilzomib in combination with daratumumab has shown substantial efficacy with tolerable safety in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in a phase 1 study. In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of carfilzomib, dexamethasone, and daratumumab versus carfilzomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. METHODS: In this randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 study, 466 patients recruited from 102 sites across North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma were randomly assigned 2:1 to carfilzomib, dexamethasone, and daratumumab (KdD) or carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd). All patients received twice per week carfilzomib at 56 mg/m(2) (20 mg/m(2); days 1 and 2 during cycle 1). Daratumumab (8 mg/kg) was administered intravenously on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1 and at 16 mg/kg weekly for the remaining doses of the first two cycles, then every 2 weeks for four cycles (cycles 3-6), and every 4 weeks thereafter. Patients received 40 mg dexamethasone weekly (20 mg for patients ≥75 years old starting on the second week). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by intention to treat. Adverse events were assessed in the safety population. This trial (NCT03158688) is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, and is active but not recruiting. FINDINGS: Between June 13, 2017, and June 25, 2018, 466 patients of 569 assessed for eligibility were enrolled. After median follow-up of approximately 17 months, median progression-free survival was not reached in the KdD group versus 15·8 months in the Kd group (hazard ratio 0·63; 95% CI 0·46-0·85; p=0·0027). Median treatment duration was longer in the KdD versus the Kd group (70·1 vs 40·3 weeks). Grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported in 253 (82%) patients in the KdD group and 113 (74%) patients in the Kd group. The frequency of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation was similar in both groups (KdD, 69 [22%]; Kd, 38 [25%]). INTERPRETATION: KdD significantly prolonged progression-free survival versus Kd in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and was associated with a favourable benefit-risk profile.

AB  - Background: Daratumumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting CD38, significantly prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) and achieves deep and durable responses when combined with other established standard-of-care regimens in patients with RRMM. Aims: To provide updated efficacy and safety data from POLLUX, a multicenter, phase 3, randomized study of DRd versus Rd in RRMM. Methods: Eligible patients with ≥1 prior line of therapy were randomly assigned to Rd (25 mg PO lenalidomide on Days 1-21 of each every-4-week [Q4W] cycle; 40 mg dexamethasone weekly) with or without daratumumab (16 mg/kg IV once weekly for Cycles 1 and 2, every 2 weeks for Cycles 3-6, then Q4W until disease progression). Patients who were refractory to lenalidomide were excluded. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Bone marrow samples were collected, and minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed at the time of suspected complete response (CR) and at 3 and 6 months after suspected CR at 3 different sensitivity thresholds (10-4, 10-5, and 10-6) using the ClonoSEQ™ next-generation sequencing-based assay (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA). Additional reflex testing using an anti-idiotype antibody was used to confirm CRs in cases in which daratumumab interference with serum M-protein quantitation was suspected in patients with possible CR. Results: Patients received a median (range) of 1 (1-11) prior lines of therapy; 55% of patients had received immunomodulatory agents (IMIDs), and 18% had been exposed to lenalidomide. After median follow-up of 17.3 months, DRd significantly prolonged PFS compared with Rd alone (median: not reached vs 17.5 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.50; P<0.0001), with 18-month PFS rates of 76% and 49%, respectively. Responses continued to deepen in the DRd group with longer follow-up, with significantly higher overall response rate (ORR; 93% vs 76%) and rates of very good partial response (VGPR) or better (78% vs 45%) and CR or better (46% vs 20%) with DRd versus Rd alone (P<0.0001 for all). MRD-negative rates were >3 times higher with DRd compared with Rd alone at all 3 sensitivity thresholds (31.8% vs 8.8% at 10-4; 24.8% vs 5.7% at 10-5; and 11.9% vs 2.5%, at 10-6; P<0.0001 for all), and MRD negativity was associated with prolonged PFS at 10-5 (Figure 1). Overall survival (OS) data are immature, with 40 (14%) deaths in the DRd group and 56 (20%) deaths in the Rd group (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42-0.95). Neutropenia was the most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse event (53% with DRd vs 38% with Rd), and no new safety signals were reported with longer follow up. We will present updated efficacy and safety data based on approximately 25 months follow up at the meeting. (Figure Presented) Summary/Conclusions: DRd significantly improved outcomes compared with Rd alone, including PFS, ORR, depth of response, and MRD-negative rates, with a favorable safety profile that was maintained after longer follow up. These updated data continue to support the use of DRd in patients with RRMM who received ≥1 prior therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Daratumumab showed promising efficacy alone and with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in a phase 1-2 study involving patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 569 patients with multiple myeloma who had received one or more previous lines of therapy to receive lenalidomide and dexamethasone either alone (control group) or in combination with daratumumab (daratumumab group). The primary end point was progression-free survival. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 13.5 months in a protocol-specified interim analysis, 169 events of disease progression or death were observed (in 53 of 286 patients [18.5%] in the daratumumab group vs. 116 of 283 [41.0%] in the control group; hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27 to 0.52; P<0.001 by stratified log-rank test). The Kaplan-Meier rate of progression-free survival at 12 months was 83.2% (95% CI, 78.3 to 87.2) in the daratumumab group, as compared with 60.1% (95% CI, 54.0 to 65.7) in the control group. A significantly higher rate of overall response was observed in the daratumumab group than in the control group (92.9% vs. 76.4%, P<0.001), as was a higher rate of complete response or better (43.1% vs. 19.2%, P<0.001). In the daratumumab group, 22.4% of the patients had results below the threshold for minimal residual disease (1 tumor cell per 10(5) white cells), as compared with 4.6% of those in the control group (P<0.001); results below the threshold for minimal residual disease were associated with improved outcomes. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 during treatment were neutropenia (in 51.9% of the patients in the daratumumab group vs. 37.0% of those in the control group), thrombocytopenia (in 12.7% vs. 13.5%), and anemia (in 12.4% vs. 19.6%). Daratumumab-associated infusion-related reactions occurred in 47.7% of the patients and were mostly of grade 1 or 2. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide and dexamethasone significantly lengthened progression-free survival among patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

AB  - Introduction: Daratumumab is a human IgGκ monoclonal antibody targeting CD38 with a direct on-tumor and immunomodulatory mechanism of action. Daratumumab induces rapid, deep, and durable responses in combination with a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib) or an immunomodulatory drug (lenalidomide or pomalidomide) in patients with RRMM (Palumbo A, et al. N Engl J Med 2016. 375(8):754-766; Dimopoulos MA, et al. N Engl J Med 2016.375(14):1319-1331; Chari A, et al. Blood 2017. Epub ahead of print). At the time of the pre-specified interim analysis of the phase 3 study POLLUX (median follow-up of 13.5 months), DRd reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 63% and significantly improved the overall response rate (ORR) compared with Rd alone (92.9% vs 76.4%; P <0.001). This analysis reports updated efficacy and safety data in POLLUX based on longer follow-up. Methods: Patients (pts) who received ≥1 prior line of therapy were randomized (1:1) to Rd (lenalidomide: 25 mg PO on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle; dexamethasone: 40 mg PO per week) with or without daratumumab (16 mg/kg IV weekly for Cycles 1 and 2, q2w for Cycles 3-6, then q4w until disease progression). The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed on bone marrow aspirate samples at the time of suspected complete response (CR) and at 3 and 6 months after suspected CR at sensitivity thresholds of 10-4, 10-5, and 10-6 via the clonoSEQ™ next-generation sequencing assay (V.1.3; Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA). For PFS on subsequent line of therapy (PFS2; defined as time from randomization to progression after next line of subsequent therapy or death) was examined as an exploratory endpoint. Results: Pts in both treatment groups (DRd, n=286; Rd, n=283) received a median of 1 prior line of therapy and 18% of patients received prior treatment with lenalidomide. After a median follow-up of 25.4 months, PFS was significantly prolonged with DRd vs Rd (median, not reached [NR] vs 17.5 months; HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.31-0.53; P <0.0001; Figure 1A). A higher ORR was observed with DRd compared with Rd (93% vs 76%; P <0.0001), including significantly higher rates of ≥very good partial response (79% vs 48%; P <0.0001) and ≥CR (51% vs 21%; P <0.0001; Figure 1B). DRd prolonged the duration of response compared with Rd (median, NR vs 26.0 months). MRD-negative rates were >3-fold higher with DRd vs Rd at all sensitivity thresholds evaluated. At a sensitivity threshold of 10-5, MRD-negative rates were 26% with DRd vs 6% for Rd (P <0.0001) and pts with MRD-negative status accumulated more rapidly with DRd vs Rd. Regardless of treatment group, PFS was prolonged in pts who achieved MRD-negative status compared with MRD-positive status. PFS2 was significantly improved with DRd vs Rd in the intent to treat (ITT) population (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.40-0.76; P=0.0002; Figure 2A). Among MRD-negative (10-5 ) pts who received DRd (n=75) or Rd (n=18), no significant differences in PFS2 were observed between treatment groups (Figure 2B). Time to next therapy was also significantly prolonged with DRd vs Rd in the ITT population (median, NR vs 22.7 months; HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.25- 0.46; P <0.0001). The most common (≥10%) grade 3/4 TEAEs included neutropenia (54% vs 40%), anemia (16% vs 21%), thrombocytopenia (14% vs 16%), and pneumonia (12% vs 9%), in pts treated with DRd vs Rd, respectively. The incidence of TEAE-related treatment discontinuations was similar between groups, occurring in 12% of pts in both treatment groups. No differences in the incidence of secondary primary malignancies were observed between treatment groups (16 [6%] patients in each group). Updated data will be presented at the meeting. Conclusion: This updated analysis reveals that DRd continues to demonstrate a significant PFS benefit compared with Rd alone, and pt responses continue to deepen with DRd with longer follow up. Pts who receive DRd demonstrated longer time to next therapy and responded more favorably to subsequent therapy as evidenced by prol nged PFS2, suggesting that patients continue to observe clinical benefit from prior daratumumab treatment. Importantly, the favorable safety profile was maintained with longer follow-up. These data support the addition of daratumumab to standard of care regimens in RRMM.

AB  - Purpose: Despite new treatment options for myeloma, poor overall survival has been reported in patients with RRMM after >3 prior therapies. The CRB-401 phase 1 study (NCT02658929) evaluated ide-cel, a BCMA CAR T-cell therapy, in RRMM patients who received ≥3 prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, or were refractory to both drug classes. The objective response rate was 85% (45% complete response rate) and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11.8 months (95% CI, 6.2-17.8.1 All 16 evaluable responding patients were minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative (≤10-4 nucleated cells).1 Ide-cel has been granted PRIME eligibility in RRMM by the European Medicines Agency. KarMMa, the phase 2 pivotal study (NCT03361748), has completed accrual (140 patients as of November 2018). Informed by these studies, KarMMa-3 (NCT03651128), a phase 3 multicenter randomized trial, is designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of ide-cel in earlier treatment lines. Methods: KarMMa-3 compares the efficacy and safety of ide-cel to those of standard triplet regimens in RRMM. Eligible patients have received 2-4 prior regimens, including an immunomodulatory drug, proteasome inhibitor, or daratumumab, and are refractory to their last therapy. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive either ide-cel treatment (150-450 × 106 CAR+ T cells) or a standard triplet regimen such as daratumumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (DPd); daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (DVd); or ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (IRd); at the investigator's discretion. The primary endpoint is PFS. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, safety, MRD-negative status, and health-related quality of life. Patient accrual is ongoing. Conclusions: Data from CRB-401 in patients with RRMM who received ≥3 prior therapies support investigating ide-cel in earlier treatment lines, as planned in KarMMa-3.

AB  - Background: Bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (VMP) and lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (Rd) have been established as standard of care regimens in newly diagnosed, transplant-ineligible multiple myeloma (MM) patients (San Miguel JF. NEJM 2008; 359: 906-17; Benboubker L. NEJM 2014; 371: 906-17). DARA is a human anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody that induces cell death in malignant MM cells. In phase I/II trials, 16 mg/kg DARA had a favorable safety profile and showed efficacy with deep responses in patients with relapsed or refractory MM as a single agent (overall response rate [ORR] 35%; Lokhorst HM. J Clin Oncol 2014; 32: 8513), and in combination with Rd (ORR 87%; Plesner T et al. Blood. 2014; 124: 84). In newly diagnosed MM patients treated with DARA plus VMP, ORR was 100% (Moreau P. Blood. 2014; 124: 176). Methods: Alcyone and Maia are randomized, open-label, phase 3 studies of DARA in patients with newly diagnosed, active MM with measurable disease and who are not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive VMP or DARA plus VMP (Alcyone) or Rd or DARA plus Rd (Maia). Approximately 700 and 730 eligible patients will be enrolled in Alcyone and Maia, respectively. Randomization will be stratified by International Staging System, age and geographic region. In Alcyone, patients will receive 1.3 mg/ m2 bortezomib subcutaneously, twice weekly during Cycle 1 (6 wks) and weekly during Cycles 2-9 as well as 9 mg/m2 melphalan and 60 mg/m2 prednisone orally on Days 1-4 of each cycle; patients in the DARA plus VMP arm will also receive 16 mg/kg DARA intravenously (IV), weekly during Cycle 1, every 3 weeks during Cycles 2-9, and every four weeks thereafter, until disease progression. In Maia, patients will receive 25 mg lenalidomide orally on Days 1-21 of each 4-week cycle and 40 mg dexamethasone weekly; patients in the Rd plus DARA arm will also receive 16 mg/kg DARA IV weekly for 8 weeks, every other week for 16 weeks, and every four weeks thereafter, until disease progression. The primary endpoint for each study will be progression-free survival. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee will review the efficacy and safety data. Approximately 200 and 230 sites in 25 and 14 countries will participate in Alcyone and Maia, respectively. The first patients were enrolled in January 2015 in Alcyone and in March 2015 in Maia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide plus dexamethasone is a standard treatment for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation. We sought to determine whether the addition of daratumumab would significantly reduce the risk of disease progression or death in this population. METHODS: We randomly assigned 737 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were ineligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation to receive daratumumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (daratumumab group) or lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (control group). Treatment was to continue until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable side effects. The primary end point was progression-free survival. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 28.0 months, disease progression or death had occurred in 240 patients (97 of 368 patients [26.4%] in the daratumumab group and 143 of 369 patients [38.8%] in the control group). The estimated percentage of patients who were alive without disease progression at 30 months was 70.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.0 to 75.4) in the daratumumab group and 55.6% (95% CI, 49.5 to 61.3) in the control group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.73; P<0.001). The percentage of patients with a complete response or better was 47.6% in the daratumumab group and 24.9% in the control group (P<0.001). A total of 24.2% of the patients in the daratumumab group, as compared with 7.3% of the patients in the control group, had results below the threshold for minimal residual disease (1 tumor cell per 10(5) white cells) (P<0.001). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were neutropenia (50.0% in the daratumumab group vs. 35.3% in the control group), anemia (11.8% vs. 19.7%), lymphopenia (15.1% vs. 10.7%), and pneumonia (13.7% vs. 7.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were ineligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation, the risk of disease progression or death was significantly lower among those who received daratumumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone than among those who received lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone. A higher incidence of neutropenia and pneumonia was observed in the daratumumab group. (Funded by Janssen Research and Development; MAIA ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02252172.).

AB  - Introduction Lenalidomide-based therapies are a standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed, transplant-ineligible MM. Daratumumab (DARA) is a human, CD38-targeted, IgG1È monoclonal antibody which has single-agent activity in heavily pretreated MM patients. As previously reported in 3 phase 3 studies, the addition of DARA to standards of care in both relapsed refractory (D-Rd, DARA plus bortezomib and dexamethasone [D-Vd]) or transplant-ineligible NDMM (DARA plus bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone [D-VMP]) resulted in a.50% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (Palumbo A, et al. N Engl J Med 2016;375:754-766; Dimopoulos MA, et al. N Engl J Med 2016;375:1319-1331; Mateos MV, et al. N Engl J Med 2018;378:518-528). Of these, the POLLUX study with D-Rd showed the greatest benefit with a 63% reduction in risk of disease progression or death in patients with MM who had at least one prior line of therapy. Based on the efficacy and tolerable safety profile of D-Rd, we conducted a phase 3 study (MAIA) to evaluate D-Rd vs Rd in transplant-ineligible NDMM. Here we report the prespecified interim analysis of the MAIA study. Methods Patients ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation due to age.65 years or comorbidities were randomized 1:1 to Rd} DARA. Stratification was based on International Staging System stage (ISS [I, II, III]), region (North America vs other), and age (<75 vs.75 years). All patients received 28-day cycles of treatment with Rd} DARA. R: 25 mg (oral) QD on Days 1-21; d: 40 mg (oral) on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22. In the D-Rd arm, DARA was given at 16 mg/kg (intravenously) QW for Cycles 1-2, Q2W for Cycles 3-6, and Q4W thereafter. In both arms, patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Key secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity rate (10 sensitivity, clonoSEQ version 2.0), and safety. Results This international study randomized 737 patients (368 to D-Rd; 369 to Rd) from 14 countries. Key baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two arms. The median (range) age was 73 (45-90) years with 44% of patients.75 years, and 52% were male. Two thirds of patients had ECOG scores.1: ECOG score 0, 34%; 1, 50%;.2, 17%. Overall, 27%, 43%, and 29% were ISS stage I, II, and III, respectively. Of 642 patients evaluable for FISH/karyotyping analysis, 86% and 14% were standard and high cytogenetic risk, respectively. The prespecified interim analysis occurred after 239 PFS events on 24 September 2018 with a median follow up of 28 months. For the primary endpoint, the hazard ratio was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.72; P <0.0001), representing a 45% reduction in the risk of progression or death in patients treated with D-Rd (Figure). The median PFS for the Rd arm was 31.9 months and not reached for the D-Rd arm. Adding DARA to Rd resulted in deeper responses with a complete response (CR) or better rate of 47.6% in the D-Rd arm compared with 24.7% in the Rd arm (odds ratio [OR] 2.75, 95% CI, 2.01 to 3.76; P <0.0001). The very good partial response (VGPR) or better rate was 79.3% in the D-Rd arm compared with 53.1% in the Rd arm (OR 3.4, 95% CI, 2.45 to 4.72; P <0.0001). A total of 19% of patients have died and the HR for OS was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.56 to 1.1); follow-up is ongoing. Higher rates (5% or more difference) of grade 3/4 pneumonia, neutropenia, and leukopenia were observed in the D-Rd arm. The safety profile is consistent with previously reported DARA studies. The complete topline data set will be presented with additional efficacy endpoints, including MRD negativity rate. Conclusion The addition of DARA to Rd in patients with transplant-ineligible NDMM significantly reduced the risk of progression or death by 45%. There are no new safety signals using DARA plus Rd in NDMM. These data together with the phase 3 ALCYONE study (D-VMP vs VMP) support the addition of DARA to standard of care combinations in patients h NDMM ineligible for transplant. [Figure Presented].

AB  - Introduction There has been a remarkable growth of new therapies for multiple myeloma (MM) in the last 5 years with 5 new agents approved by the FDA. Daratumumab is a human anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody previously approved as a single agent in relapsed/refractory (RR) MM and as combination in relapsed MM. Selinexor represents a novel first-in-class selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) XPO1 antagonist in RRMM. The perception of practicing community hematologists and oncologists (H/O) regarding new information presented at major scientific meetings has implications for all stakeholders including patients, practices, payers, manufacturers and distributors. We conducted market research with H/O to understand how MM data presented at ASH 2018 and ASCO 2019 might alter their treatment preferences. Methods Live meetings in February and June 2019 convened H/O with geographic representations from S across the United States. The participants were shown data from selected oral and/or poster presentations from the 2018 ASH Annual Meeting or 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting and responded to questions regarding their perceptions of the data and its potential impact on current practice. The presentations used included the following: 1) MAIA: a phase III, randomized study in patients with transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) comparing daratumumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Rd) to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) alone (Facon T, et al. Blood. 2018;132[Suppl 1]:LBA-2); 2) CASSIOPEIA: a phase III, randomized study in patients with transplant-eligible NDMM comparing daratumumab plus bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (D-VTd) to bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (VTd) alone (Moreau P, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2019;37[15-suppl]:8003); and 3) STORM: a pivotal, phase II, single-arm study of selinexor and dexamethasone in patients with penta-refractory MM (Chari A, et al. Blood. 2018;132[Suppl 1]:598). Participants submitted their demographic responses via a web-based survey prior to the meetings and data impression responses via an audience response system at the live meetings. Results Among the 112 H/O who participated in these live market research programs on February 22-23 and June 21-22, 2019, 58% identified their primary specialty as hematology/oncology and 38% medical oncology. Only 27% of the 59 H/O at the February live meeting had attended the ASH 2018 in December 2018 and 43% of the 53 at the June live meeting had attended the ASCO 2019 in June 2019. The participants were mostly community-based physicians, 47% in private community and 48% in community practices owned by a hospital or academic center. 31% have been in practice for over 20 years, 39% for 11-20 years and 29% for 10 or fewer years. The majority of this group sees at least 16 patients per day and reported active MM as one of the three most common hematologic malignancies they manage. At the February 2019 live meeting, 79% of H/O in attendance indicated that, based on the results of the MAIA study, D-Rd is likely to become their standard of care for patients with NDMM who are ineligible for transplant. At the June 2019 live meeting, the majority of H/O in attendance indicated that bortezomib + lenalidomide + dexamethasone (VRd) was the regimen typically used for their transplant-eligible NDMM patients. After reviewing the data from the CASSIOPEIA study of D-VTd, 50% of H/O indicated that the results are practice-changing and will be widely adopted, but thalidomide will be substituted with lenalidomide (D-VRd). 65% of H/O who attended the February 2019 live meeting indicated that, if selinexor is approved by the FDA, they are very likely to consider it for their patients with RRMM. 76% of advisors indicated that selinexor's novel mechanism of action (MOA) is very clinically meaningful in MM. S Qualitative data collected also denotes interest in seeing selinexor tested and moved to earlier lines of therapy akin to the development course followed by daratumumab. Conclusions The movement of daratumumab to the first-line setting was well received by the community H/O and their willingness to substitute IMiD drugs in the backbone regimen for transplant-eligible patients was notable. It is noteworthy that the interest in selinexor was high even prior to its FDA approval and especially driven by its novel MOA.

AB  - Background: The addition of daratumumab to backbone multiple myeloma (MM) regimens leads to improved response rates and progression free survival (PFS). Whether improved outcomes are also seen among patients with high-risk cytogenetics (HRC) remains unclear, particularly in newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) setting. Aims: To evaluate the impact of daratumumab in treatment outcomes MM according to cytogenetic risk utilizing meta-analysis methodology and levaraging data from randomized trials. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of bibliographic databases, clinical trials registries and meeting libraries from inception to December 2019, for phase III randomized trials that compared backbone MM regimens vs. same regimen plus daratumumab either in NDMM or relapsed/refractory setting (RRMM) and reported outcomes by cytogenetic risk (HRC vs standard risk cytogenetics, SRC). We defined HRC as presence of t(4;14), t(14;16) or del(17p). The primary endpoint was PFS. We pooled relative log-hazard ratios using DerSimonian-Laird random- effects model. We assessed heterogeneity using Cochran's Q and the I2 statistic. Results: Of 3070 study screened, 6 phase III trials were included. This included 3 trials in NDMM (Alcyone, Maia and Cassiopeia, 2,528 patients, 358 HRC) and 3 trials in RRMM (Castor, Pollux and Candor, 1,533 patients, 222 HRC). The addition of daratumumab to NDMM backbone regimens among patients with HRC led to improved PFS (pooled HR 0.666; 95% CI 0.468-0.949, p value 0.025) with little heterogeneity (Cochrans Q p value = 0.766, I2 = 0), similar to RRMM setting (pooled HR 0.451; 95% CI 0.303-0.670, p value < 0.001, Cochran's Q = 0.630, p value < 0.001, I2 = 0). Similar results were seen in SRC s in NDMM setting (pooled HR 0.445; 95% CI 0.369-0.538, p value < 0.001, Cochrans Q p value = 0.486, I2 = 0) and RRMM setting (pooled HR 0.378; 95% CI 0.253-0.564; p value < 0.001, Cochran's Q p value = 0.036, I2 = 70%). Summary/Conclusion: Incorporating Daratumumab to backbone regimens led to improved PFS among patients with HRC in both NDMM and RRMM settings. Lack of substantial heterogeneity suggests benefit of daratumumab regardless of backbone regimen. Daratumumab-based regimens are appropriate choices in NDMM and RRMM setting for both SRC and HRC patients.

AB  - Introduction: Proteasome inhibitors-based regimens are the mainstay of initial therapy for most patients with multiple myeloma. Daratumumab is a human IgGK monoclonal antibody that targets CD38 with direct antitumor effects and has an immunomodulatory component. Recent studies have demonstrated that addition of daratumumab to standard regimens enhance direct cytotoxicity on myeloma cells and have shown survival benefits. Yet, there are notable safety concerns. We performed a combined analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) to determine the risk of second primary malignancies (SPM) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) with newer daratumumab combination regimens. Methods: We systematically conducted a comprehensive literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE S databases and meeting abstracts from inception through June 2019. Phase III RCTs utilizing daratumumab in patients with multiple myeloma that mention SPM and PSN as adverse effects were incorporated in the analysis. Mantel-Haenszel (MH) method was used to calculate the estimated pooled risk ratio (RR), and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed with Cochran's Q- statistic. Random effects model was applied. Results: A total of 3,547 patients with multiple myeloma from 5 phase III RCTs were eligible. Studies compared daratumumab (D) + bortezomib (V) + melphan (M) + prednisone (P) vs VMP, D + lenalidomide (R) + dexamethasone (d) vs Rd, DVd vs Vd and DVd + thalidomide (T) vs VTd. The randomization ratio was 1:1 in all studies. Daratumumab was utilized in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in the POLLUX study (n= 564) and the CASTOR study (n= 480) and as first-line treatment for patients with multiple myeloma in the ALCYONE study (n= 700), the CASSIOPEIA study (n= 1085) and the MAIA study (n= 737). The I2 statistic for heterogeneity was 25, suggesting some heterogeneity among RCT The SPM incidence was 76 (4.29%) in study group vs 77 (4.34%) in control group. The RR for SPM was 1.12 (95% CI: 0.74 - 1.69; P = 0.58) and RD was 0.01 (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.02; P = 0.34). The RR for SPM was noted at 2.56 (95% CI: 0.26 - 25.46; P = 0.42) in a subset of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Any-grade PSN was reported in 527 (46.84%) in daratumumab arm vs 550 (48.72%) in control arm with the RR of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.80 -1.21; P = 0.88). High-grade PSN was noted in 63 (5.6%) vs 76 (6.73%) in control group with the RR of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.42 -1.27; P = 0.27). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis depicted that there was no significant increase in the risk of second primary malignancies and peripheral sensory neuropathy in patients on daratumumab combination regimen, in newly diagnosed and relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, compared to control arm. However, long-term follow-up of these patients is required to determine the actual relation with second primary malignancies.

AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy of abnormal clonal plasma cell proliferation which accounts for 1% of all cancers. Over the last few years, introduction of novel agents has become a therapeutic landmark in the management of newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) and relapsed or refractory MM (RRMM), in both transplant - eligible and transplant - ineligible patients. Studies have shown that daratumumab, a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody targeting CD38 on myeloma cells, monotherapy or in combination with proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory agents and/ or other antimyeloma therapies increased survival in the treatment of MM. We undertook an updated meta-analysis of phase III randomised controlled trials (RCT) to determine the efficacy of daratumumab combination regimen in patients with NDMM and RRMM. We systematically conducted a comprehensive literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE databases and meeting abstracts from inception through 10th December 2019. Phase III RCTs utilising daratumumab in patients with NDMM and RRMM were incorporated in the analysis. A generic inverse variance method was used to calculate the estimated pooled hazard ratio (HR) for progression-free survival (PFS) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Mantel-Haenszel (MH) method was used to calculate the estimated pooled risk ratio (RR) for overall response rate (ORR), and complete response (CR) and stringent complete response (sCR). Heterogeneity was assessed with I2 and Cochran's Q -statistic. A 'p value' of less than 0.05 was considered significant and I2 >50% is considered substantially heterogeneous. Six phase III RCTs (POLLUX, CASTOR, CANDOR, ALCYONE, CASSIOPEIA and MAIA studies) with a total of 4,025 patients with NDMM (n = 2528) and RRMM (n = 1497) were included. Studies compared daratumumab (D) + bortezomib (V) + melphalan (M) + prednisolone (P) vs VMP, D + lenalidomide (R) + dexamethasone (d) vs Rd, DVd + thalidomide (T) vs VTd, DVD vs Vd and Carfilzomib (K) + d + D vs Kd. Daratumumab was utilised in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in the POLLUX, CASTOR and CANDOR studies, and as first-line treatment for patients with multiple myeloma in the ALCYONE, CASSIOPEIA, and MAIA studies. The randomisation ratio was 2:1 in the CANDOR study and 1:1 in other studies. The I2 statistic showed some heterogeneity among RCTs and random effects model was applied. The pooled HR for overall PFS was statistically significant at 0.47 (95% CI: 0.38-0.57; P <0.00001). The pooled HR for PFS was calculated for each subset; NDMM (HR 0.52, 95% CI: 0.44-0.61; P <0.00001) and RRMM (HR 0.43, 95% CI: 0.29-0.63; P <0.0001). The PFS benefit was observed in both standard risk cytogenetic and high risk cytogenetic cohorts; standard risk cytogenetic cohort (HR 0.38, 95% CI: 0.30-0.48; P <0.00001) and high risk cytogenetic cohort (HR 0.63, 95% CI: 0.48-0.82; P = 0.0005). ORR was 90.16 % in daratumumab arm vs 78.92% in control arm and the pooled RR was significant at 1.17 (95% CI: 1.08-1.27; P = 0.0002). The rate of CR and sCR was 18.38 % higher in daratumumab combination regimen compared to control group. The pooled RR was statistically significant at 2.03 (95% CI: 1.66-2.47; P <0.00001). Our meta-analysis showed that daratumumab combination regimens significantly improved PFS, ORR and CR and sCR compared to control arm in patients with NDMM and RRMM. The improvement in PFS was observed in both high and standard risk cytogenetic cohorts.

AB  - 3192.). Here, we report the results of a prespecified interim analysis of the phase 3 LEPUS (MMY3009) study in Chinese pts. Aims: To compare the efficacy and safety of D-Vd vs Vd in Chinese pts with RRMM. Methods: In LEPUS, pts with ≥1 prior line of therapy were randomized 2:1 to 8 cycles (21 d/cycle) of V (1.3 mg/m2 SC) on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and dexamethasone (20 mg PO or IV) on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 ± D (16 mg/kg IV) given QW for Cycles 1-3, Q3W for Cycles 4-8, and Q4W thereafter. Prior proteasome-inhibitor (PI) treatment was permitted, but pts refractory to a PI were ineligible. The primary endpoint was PFS. Results: A total of 211 pts were randomized (D-Vd, 141; Vd, 70) across 27 study sites. The median (range) age was 61 (28-82) years. Pts had received a median (range) of 2 (1-11) prior lines of therapy; 79% had received prior V, 27% were refractory to lenalidomide, and 64% were refractory to their last prior line of therapy. After a median (range) follow-up of 8.2 (0-20.5) mo, D-Vd significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 72% vs Vd (median PFS, not reached [NR] vs 6.3 mo; hazard ratio [HR], 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.47; P < 0.00001; Figure). The PFS benefit of D-Vd vs Vd was maintained across prespecified subgroups, including pts with prior V (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.19-0.51) and with high-risk cytogenetics (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18-0.75). Median time to progression was significantly prolonged for D-Vd vs Vd (NR vs 6.5 mo; HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.15-0.46; P < 0.00001). Among response-evaluable pts (D-Vd, 137; Vd, 63), the addition of daratumumab to Vd significantly improved the overall response rate (83% vs 65%; P = 0.00527) and rates of very good partial response or better (65% vs 33%; P = 0.00002) and complete response or better (33 vs 11%; P = 0.00079). Median time to first response was numerically shorter for D-Vd vs Vd (0.79 mo vs 1.05 mo), and median duration of response was NR with D-Vd vs 6.9 mo with Vd. There were a total of 31 deaths, 13 (9%) in the D-Vd group vs 18 (26%) in the Vd group (overall survival HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.16-0.68; P = 0.00162); follow-up is ongoing. All treated pts in both treatment groups (D-Vd, 140; Vd, 68) had ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). 89% of pts in the D-Vd group and 75% of pts in the Vd group experienced a Grade 3/4 TEAE; the most common (≥10%; D-Vd/Vd) were thrombocytopenia (51%/37%), lymphopenia (44%/29%), lung infection (30%/22%), anemia (25%/19%), leukopenia (20%/7%), neutropenia (16%/6%), hypokalemia (14%/12%), upper respiratory tract infection (14%/4%), and hypertension (12%/3%). 49% of D-Vd pts and 38% of Vd pts had ≥1 serious AE, and 4% of D-Vd pts and 3% of Vd pts had a TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation. 4% of D-Vd pts and 10% of Vd pts had a TEAE leading to death. Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) occurred in 38% of D-Vd pts. Most IRRs (96%) occurred during the first infusion, and the majority were Grade 1 or 2 (6% of pts had grade 3 IRRs, and no Grade ≥4 IRRs were reported). Summary/Conclusion: In LEPUS, D-Vd improved outcomes, including significantly improved PFS, in RRMM pts. The safety profile was consistent with the known profile of D-Vd, with no new safety concerns identified. These data support the addition of daratumumab to the standard-of-care regimen Vd for Chinese RRMM pts.

AB  - Background: High-dose therapy (HDT) followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard of care in TE NDMM. In the phase 3 CASSIOPEIA study, D-VTd significantly improved stringent complete response (sCR), ≥CR, and minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative rates and reduced the risk of progression/death vs VTd in TE NDMM pts. We assessed SC yield and transplantation results among pts receiving D-VTd vs VTd induction prior to HDT/ASCT in Part 1 of CASSIOPEIA. Methods:In Part 1, TE NDMM pts ages 18-65 y were randomized 1:1 to 4 pretransplant induction and 2 post-transplant consolidation cycles of DARA + VTd or VTd alone. After induction, pts underwent SC mobilization with cyclophosphamide 3 g/m2(recommended dose) and GCSF. Peripheral blood SCs were harvested based on response to mobilization. Plerixafor was given if SC collection failed at first attempt and in accordance with institutional practice. Melphalan 200 mg/m2 IV was given as HDT prior to ASCT. Results: A total of 1085 pts were randomized (D-VTd, 543; VTd, 542). Among pts who completed mobilization (D-VTd, 506; VTd, 492), more pts receiving D-VTd vs VTd received plerixafor during mobilization (21.7% vs 7.9%). Pts underwent a median (range) of 2 (1-6) vs 1 (1-4) days of apheresis for D-VTd vs VTd. The median number of CD34+ cells collected was lower for D-VTd vs VTd (6.3×106/kg vs 8.9×106/kg). Nevertheless, a similar percentage of ITT pts receiving D-VTd vs VTd underwent ASCT (90.1% vs 89.3%). The median number of CD34+ cells transplanted for D-VTd vs VTd was 3.3×106/kg vs 4.3×106/kg. Hematopoietic reconstitution rates were high and similar for transplanted pts receiving D-VTd vs VTd (99.8% vs 99.6%). For D-VTd vs VTd, a median (range) of 13.0 (6-54) vs 13.0 (4-43) days was required to achieve sustained ANC > 500 cells/mm3, and a median (range) of 14.0 (2-56) vs 12.0 (1-47) days was required to achieve sustained platelets > 20,000 cells/mm3 without transfusion. Conclusions: SC mobilization and collection was feasible with D-VTd induction. Adding DARA to VTd allowed successful transplantation in pts with TE NDMM.

AB  - Introduction: Standard-of-care (SoC) frontline treatments in Latin America (LATAM) for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who are transplant ineligible include bortezomiband thalidomide-based regimens. The uptake of novel MM therapies has been slow in the past decade in LATAM. Recently, the phase 3 ALCYONE study demonstrated that D-VMP significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and led to higher rates of deeper responses compared with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (VMP) therapy alone for patients with NDMM who were transplant ineligible (Mateos MV, et al. NEJM. 2018;378[6]:518-528). In this propensity score matching (PSM) analysis, we compared the efficacy of D-VMP with SoC regimens used in LATAM in patients with NDMM who were transplant ineligible. Methods: Data for the D-VMP cohort were from the randomized, multicenter, open-label, international, phase 3 ALCYONE study, which enrolled patients from 162 sites in 25 countries between February 9, 2015 and July 14, 2016. Patients (N = 706) were randomly assigned to receive 9 cycles of VMP alone (n = 356) or with daratumumab until disease progression (D-VMP; n = 350). Data for the LATAM SoC cohort were from the retrospective, observational Hemato-Oncology Latin America (HOLA) study of patients with selected hematologic malignancies seen in 30 sites across 7 countries in LATAM from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2015. Patients were required to be ≥18 years of age at MM diagnosis, to have follow-up data for ≥1 year following diagnosis or until death, and to have never received autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). Follow-up continued until the patient's death or December 31, 2016, whichever occurred first. PSM was conducted to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics between the ALCYONE study and the HOLA registry. Several matching algorithms were tested (eg, exact, optimal, and nearest neighbor). The matching method with the lowest average standardized difference was used for further analyses. Considered baseline characteristics included median age (71 vs 64 years), male sex (46% vs 50%), International Staging System (ISS) I-III (20%, 40%, and 41% vs 11%, 19%, 35% and NA=34%), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (1% vs 33%), and hypercalcemia (11% vs 20%). Outcomes of interest were overall survival (OS) and PFS. OS and PFS were compared based on Cox hazard models. The following outcome regressions were conducted: naïve and multivariate regression on matched samples. The latter was the base case, as differences in baseline characteristics might persist after matching. Results: A total of 350 patients from the D-VMP ALCYONE cohort and 729 patients from LATAM in the HOLA cohort were considered for analysis. All D-VMP patients were included; among the HOLA cohort, 478 patients were not missing data for baseline characteristics and were included in the analysis of OS and PFS. The chi-square test showed that baseline characteristics were significantly different between the cohorts. The nearest neighbour PSM with caliper 0.05 was selected for OS and PFS. After matching, the chi-square test demonstrated that baseline characteristics of remaining matched patients were well-balanced (no significant differences in covariates) between D-VMP (n = 207) and HOLA (n = 207) in terms of median age (70 vs 70 years), sex (male, 50% vs 47%), ISS I-III (16%, 38%, and 46% vs 22%, 38%, and 40%), CKD (2% vs 3%), and hypercalcemia (16% vs 14%). DVMP showed statistically significantly better OS and PFS compared with HOLA. The naïve hazard ratio for OS was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.34-0.61) and for PFS was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.34-0.50); the base case hazard ratio for OS was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.32-0.73) and for PFS was 0.44 (95% CI: 0.33-0.58; Figure). Conclusions: This analysis demonstrated a benefit of D-VMP over SoC treatments in LATAM for OS and PFS. Results should be considered in the context that ALCYONE OS data are immature, and there are potential limitations of temporal bias, measurement bias, and bias due to unobserved confounding factors between the t o cohorts.

AB  - In recent years, many antibody therapies for multiple myeloma have been developed. Antibodies against SLAMF7, CD38, B-cell maturation antigen and PD-1 have been developed and clinical trials are currently under way. As of July 2017, antibodies clinically available in Japan for the treatment of multiple myeloma are elotuzumab against SLAMF7 and daratumumab against CD38. Elotuzumab is a humanized IgG1-kappa monoclonal antibody targeting human SLAMF7. SLAMF7 is a cell surface glycoprotein receptor highly expressed on multiple myeloma cells, and it is also expressed on natural killer cells and is critical for natural killer function. Binding of elotuzumab to natural killer cells leads to activation of natural killer cells, resulting in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of elotuzumab-bound multiple myeloma cells, but not complement-dependent cytotoxicity. The result of a randomized phase III trial of elotuzumab+lenalidomide+dexamethasone (ELOQUENT-2) reduced the risk of disease progression/death by 30% vs lenalidomide+dexamethasone in relapse/refractory multiple myeloma. Daratumumab is a human anti-CD38 IgG1-kappa antibody. CD38 is expressed ubiquitously virtually in all tissues that are highly expressed on plasma cells and it represents an attractive target for immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies. In the phase III CASTOR trial, patients treated with daratumumab+bortezomib+dexamethasone had a better CR rate and progression-free survival rate compared with bortezomib+dexamethasone-treated patients (29% vs 10%, median progression-free survival: 16.7 vs 7.1 months, respectively). Moreover, in the phase III POLLUX trial, patients treated with daratumumab+lenalidomide+dexamethasone had a better response and progression-free survival (CRR or better: 55% vs 23%, 30-month progression-free survival: 58% vs 35%), compared with lenalidomide+dexamethasone-treated patients.

AB  - Background: Patients with high-risk (HiR) multiple myeloma (MM) or primary plasma cell leukaemia (PCL) are in urgent need of improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In a recent analysis of over 1000 transplant-eligible newly diagnosed NCRI Myeloma XI trial patients, those with double-hit tumours (≥2 high-risk markers t (4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), gain(1q) or del(17p)) and ISS2/3 had a median PFS of only 20 months (95% CI: 18-24 months) from initial randomisation. Outcome is equally adverse for gene expression profiling (GEP) SKY92-positive MM. We designed the UK OPTIMUM (MUK9) trial to address this unmet need by testing feasibility of central integrated risk profiling and efficacy of intensive immuno-biological therapy for HiR MM. Trial design: Patients with suspected or newly diagnosed MM and fit for intensive therapy were consented to the OPTIMUMscreen (MUK9A) protocol for central molecular CD138+ bone marrow profiling of translocations, copy number aberrations (qRT-PCR; MLPA P425, MRC Holland) and SKY92 high-risk GEP signature (MMprofiler; SkylineDx). Patients found to have non-HiR MM received SOC (VTD, HD-MEL+ASCT), whereas patients with HiR MM by doublehit and/or SKY92 or PCL were offered participation in OPTIMUMtreat (MUK9B). Treatment in OPTIMUMtreat consisted of daratumumab, cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone (Dara-CVRd) induction (6 cycles), bortezomib-augmented single HD-MEL+ASCT, Dara-VRd consolidation 1 (6 cycles), Dara-VR consolidation 2 (12 cycles) and Dara-R maintenance (until PD). Dose adjustments were permitted in order to maximize tolerability of long-term therapy. Primary end-point for OPTIMUMscreen is feasibility of central molecular testing. Primary end-point for OPTIMUMtreat is treatment efficacy, comparing against a predefined near-concurrent 'digital comparator' of matched HiR Myeloma XI patients using a Bayesian design. Results: From September 2017 to July 2019, 472 patients with suspected MM or PCL were recruited across 39 NHS hospitals to OPTIMUMscreen. Of these, 379 patients were found to have symptomatic MM and 10 had PCL. The remainder were diagnosed with MGUS (n = 36), no MM (n = 16) or withdrew consent (n = 31). Central bone marrow CD138+ genetic and GEP risk profiles were successfully generated for 93% of patients. Low bone marrow aspirate quality was the commonest reason for technical failure of test. Median risk status turnaround time was 18 days (IQR 13-22), well below protocol defined maximum limit of 8 weeks. HiR status by genetic double-hit and/or SKY92 was detected in 38% of tumours, mirroring retrospective results in Myeloma XI. The t(11;14) translocation was present in 50% of PCL patients, consistent with previous retrospective PCL datasets. A total of 108 patients with confirmed HiR MM or PCL were enrolled in OPTIMUMtreat, 19 were deemed ineligibile by investigators and 11 withdrew consent. The majority of patients have now completed Dara-CVRD induction successfully and are continuing on trial. A total of 251 non-HiR patients are receiving SOC (VTD/ASCT) and are followed up in OPTIMUMscreen. Discussion: We demonstrate for the first time feasibility of central genetic+GEP risk assessment in this UK multicentre trial for newly diagnosed MM. Recruitment completed 9 months ahead of projections, demonstrating the urgent need for novel approaches for HiR patients. Results also confirm the use of innovative trial concepts like the 'digital comparator' Bayesian design used in OPTIMUM for populations in need.

AB  - Introduction: Daratumumab, a human IgGκ monoclonal antibody targeting CD38 with a direct ontumor and immunomodulatory mechanism of action, is approved in combination with standard-ofcare regimens for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) and RRMM. When combined with standard of care regimens across four phase 3 studies, daratumumab demonstrated ≥44% reductions in the risk of progression or death, nearly doubled complete response (CR) or better rates, and tripled minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative rates at the 10-5 sensitivity threshold in pts with RRMM or NDMM (Palumbo A, et al. N Engl J Med 2016. 375[8]:754-766; Dimopoulos MA, et al. N Engl J Med 2016. 375[14]:1319-1331; Mateos MV, et al. N Engl J Med 2018. 378[6]:518-528; Facon T, et al. N Engl J Med 2019. 380[22]2104-2015). In the phase 3 POLLUX study (median follow-up 44.3 months), D-Rd reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 56% and significantly increased the overall response rate (ORR) versus Rd alone (93% vs 76%; P <0.0001) in patients (pts) with RRMM. Here, we present updated efficacy and safety analyses of POLLUX after >4 years of median follow-up. Methods: Pts who received ≥1 prior line of therapy were randomized (1:1) to Rd (lenalidomide 25 mg PO on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle; dexamethasone 40 mg per week) ± daratumumab (16 mg/kg IV QW for Cycles 1-2, Q2W for Cycles 3-6, then Q4W until disease progression). Cytogenetic risk was determined by local fluorescence in situ hybridization or karyotyping; pts with high cytogenetic risk had t(4;14), t(14;16), and del17p abnormalities. PFS on subsequent line of therapy (PFS2), an exploratory endpoint, was defined as time from randomization to progression after next line of subsequent therapy or death. Results: A total of 569 pts were randomized (D-Rd, n = 286; Rd, n = 283). At a median follow-up of 51.3 months, D-Rd significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus Rd (median 45.8 vs 17.5 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.54; P <0.0001; Figure). D-Rd also prolonged PFS versus Rd among pts with 1 prior line of therapy, among pts with 1-3 prior lines of therapy, and regardless of cytogenetic risk status (Table). A PFS benefit with D-Rd was also observed among pts who received prior lenalidomide (median 38.8 vs 18.6 months; HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.19-0.59; P <0.0001) and among pts refractory to bortezomib (median 34.3 vs 11.3 months; HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.25-0.68; P = 0.0004). D-Rd was associated with a significantly higher ORR versus Rd (93% vs 76%), including higher rates of ≥very good partial response (81% vs 49%) and ≥CR (57% vs 24%; all P <0.0001). Median time to next therapy for D-Rd versus Rd was not reached in the D-Rd group versus 22.8 months in the Rd group (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.30-0.49; P <0.0001). D-Rd significantly prolonged PFS2 versus Rd (median 53.3 vs 31.6 months; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.43-0.68; P <0.0001). In the D-Rd group, 121 deaths were observed versus 133 deaths in the Rd group; follow-up for overall survival is ongoing. The median duration of treatment was 34.3 months in the D-Rd arm versus 16.0 months in the Rd arm. The most common (≥10%) grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) observed with D-Rd versus Rd included neutropenia (56% vs 42%), anemia (18% vs 22%), thrombocytopenia (15% vs 16%), pneumonia (16% vs 10%), and diarrhea (10% vs 4%). Similar rates of discontinuations due to TEAEs were observed for D-Rd versus Rd (16% vs 15%). The incidence of invasive second primary malignancies was 4.9% and 5.7% for the D-Rd and Rd groups, respectively. Additional efficacy data, including minimal residual disease, and safety analyses will be presented at the meeting. Conclusion: After >4 years of median follow-up, D-Rd continues to demonstrate a significant PFS benefit and higher rates of deeper responses versus Rd alone in pts with RRMM. Although significant PFS benefit was observed with D-Rd in RRMM pts regardless of prior lines of therapy or cytogenetic risk status, the greatest benefit was obser ed when used in patients treated earlier with D-Rd. The significant improvement in PFS2 suggests a potential survival benefit, but OS data is still immature. No new safety concerns were identified with this additional follow-up. (Figure Presented).

AB  - INTRODUCTION. Bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd) is considered a standard of care combination therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. Prior studies show that ~25% of patients treated with 8 cycles of VRd achieve minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity. Recently, 42% stringent complete response (sCR) rates were reported with the use of VRd combined with the CD38-targeted monoclonal antibody daratumumab (VRd-D). Prior studies using 8 cycles of bi-weekly carfilzomib 36 mg/m2 with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (bKRd) combination therapy in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma show ~40% MRD negativity rates. We were motivated to develop a phase 2 study (total N=82) using weekly dosing of carfilzomib 56 mg/m2 with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (wKRd) in combination with daratumumab (wKRd-D). Our study Salso included a parallel cohort of bi-weekly dosing of carfilzomib 36 mg/m2 with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (bKRd) in combination with daratumumab (bKRd-D). Primary end-point of our study was to rule out 60% and to target up to 80% MRD negativity rate. METHODS. This is a two-arm, Phase II clinical trial based on Simon's optimal two-stage design. The once-a-week carfilzomib (wKRd) (N=41) has the following treatment schedule: 8 cycles of treatment; 28-day cycles with carfilzomib 20/56 mg/m2 days 1, 8, and 15; lenalidomide 25 mg days 1-21; dexamethasone 40 mg weekly cycles 1-4, 20 mg after cycle 4; and daratumumab 16 mg/kg days 1, 8, 15, and 22 cycles 1-2, days 1 and 15 cycles 3-6, and day 1 cycles 7-8. The bi-weekly carfilzomib (bKRd) (N=41): 8 cycles of treatment; 28-day cycles with carfilzomib 20/36 mg/m2 days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16; lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and daratumumab are given at the same doses/schedules as the weekly cohort. For fit patients, stem cell collection is recommended after 4 to 6 cycles of therapy; DKRd therapy is resumed after collection to a total of 8 cycles DKRd. Treatment response is being assessed with parallel bone marrow-based MRD assays (10-color single tube flowcytometry and invivoscribe IGHV sequencing); per IMWG guidelines both MRD assays allow detection of 1 myeloma cell in 100,000 bone marrow cells (10-5). Baseline bone marrow samples are evaluated with targeted DNA sequencing for FISH-Seq and somatic mutational characteristics (myTYPE). RESULTS. The first stage of the weekly cohort (wKRd-D) is fully enrolled (N=28) and the second stage of the cohort (N=13) is anticipated to complete enrollment shortly (total N=41). Currently, 29 patients meeting eligibility criteria were enrolled (14 males, 15 females) between October 2018 and August 2019. Baseline characteristics include; median age 59 years (range 36-70 years); 12 (41%) patients had high-risk FISH/SNP signature defined as one or more of the following: 1q+, t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), and 17p-. At the submission of this abstract, 28 patients have completed one or more cycles wKRd-D; among these, 10 patients have completed therapy. The median number of cycles delivered is currently 6 (range 1-8). Seven of the 10 patients who have completed study treatment are MRD negative. So far, additional 8 patients have become MRD negative while on therapy. Thus, among patients treated on the weekly cohort (wKRd-D) and who were evaluable for the MRD primary end-point at this analysis, we found 15/18 (83%) to be MRD negative. We further show no added major clinical toxicities with wKRd-D compared to our institution standard of care bKRd. The bi-weekly carfilzomib cohort (bKRd-D) shows similar results to the weekly cohort (wKRd-D). With a comparable efficacy and safety profile coupled with a substantial reduction of the number of infusions (total of 51 vs 27 infusions with bKRd-D vs wKRd-D, respectively), we conclude that the weekly dosing (wKRd-D) may offer an attractive treatment modality for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. CONCLUSIONS. Among patients evaluable for the MRD primary end-point, in the absence of an S autologous bone marrow transplant, we show an unprecedented 15/18 (83%) MRD negativity rate ng newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients treated on the weekly cohort (wKRd-D) using carfilzomib 56 mg/m2 dosing. Our promising results have prompted the development of a large randomized multi-center study (“ADVANCE”) evaluating wKRd-D in relation to established standard of care, which is anticipated to start enrollment in Q3/Q4 of 2019.

AB  - Introduction : Daratumumab (D) is a human monoclonal antibody targeting CD38 that is approved as monotherapy and in combination with immunomodulatory drugs (lenalidomide or pomalidomide) or a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib) for RRMM. The combination of D and bortezomib plus dexamethasone (DVd) was compared to Vd in CASTOR (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02136134), a randomized, multicenter, phase 3 study in patients with RRMM. In the primary analysis, 29 deaths in DVd and 36 deaths in Vd were observed (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47- 1.26; Palumbo et al, N Engl J Med 2016;375(8):754-66). Here, we provide an updated analysis of overall survival (OS) in CASTOR. Methods : Eligible patients received ≥1 prior line of therapy and were randomly assigned to receive 8 cycles (every 3 weeks) of Vd (V 1.3 mg/m2 subcutaneously on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11; d 20 mg orally or intravenously (IV) on Days 1-2, 4-5, 8-9, and 11-12) with or without D (16 mg/kg IV once weekly in Cycles 1-3, every 3 weeks for Cycles 4-8, and every 4 weeks thereafter until disease progression). Patients who were refractory to bortezomib were ineligible. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. OS was a secondary endpoint. Minimal residual disease (MRD) via next generation sequencing was assessed upon suspected complete response and at 6 and 12 months after the first dose at 3 sensitivity thresholds (10-4, 10-5, and 10-6) using the clonoSEQ™ assay (Version 1.3, Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA). A pre-specified interim analysis of OS was planned after 160 OS events had accrued. Results : 251 patients received DVd and 247 patients received Vd. The median (range) age was 64.0 (30-88) years. Patients received a median of 2 (1-10) prior therapies; 61% received prior autologous stem cell transplant, 66% received prior bortezomib (with 13% receiving >1 prior bortezomibcontaining regimen), 42% received prior lenalidomide, 48% received prior proteasome inhibitor plus immunomodulatory drug, 28% were refractory to lenalidomide, and 32% were refractory to their last line of therapy. The median duration of treatment with single-agent daratumumab after receiving 8 cycles of Vd was 11.9 months. After median follow-up of 19.4 (range: 0-27.7) months, median OS has not been reached in either treatment group in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (Figure 1A)andin patients who received 1 prior line of therapy (Figure1B). An exploratory analysis of the number of OS events and the 24-month OS rates revealed fewer deaths with DVd vs Vd in the ITT population and in subgroups based on the number of prior lines of therapy (Table). Among MRD-negative patients at the 10 sensitivity threshold, no OS events occurred in patients receiving DVd (n=29) versus 1 OS event being reported in the Vd arm (n=6). Among patients previously treated with bortezomib, the 24-month OS rate was 68% with DVd (n=162) vs 52% with Vd (n=164). Among patients refractory to lenalidomide, the 24-month OS rate was 62% and 47% with DVd (n=60) and Vd (n=81), respectively. Conclusions : Updated OS data and additional subgroup analyses will be presented at the meeting based on a pre-specified analysis of OS after 160 OS events. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Trial in Progress Background: Daratumumab, a human anti-CD38 IgGκ monoclonal antibody, is approved in many countries as monotherapy in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), and in combination with standard-of-care regimens in RRMM and transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). Daratumumab is also under investigation as induction, consolidation, and maintenance treatment in transplant-eligible NDMM. The phase 3 AURIGA (MMY3021) study will evaluate the conversion rate to minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity after 1 year of maintenance treatment with daratumumab plus lenalidomide versus lenalidomide alone following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Methods: In this ongoing multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 3 study, approximately 214 patients from up to 60 sites in the United States will be randomized 1:1 to daratumumab plus lenalidomide versus lenalidomide alone, stratified by cytogenetic risk. Eligible patients (18-79 years of age) are those with NDMM who have completed 4-8 total cycles of induction therapy (and/or consolidation therapy), have undergone ASCT, and are MRD-positive by next-generation flow (NGF) or next-generation sequencing (NGS). At the time of randomization, patients must be 60-100 days post-ASCT (≤60 days post-treatment for patients receiving consolidation therapy) and must have achieved a very good partial response or better per International Myeloma Working Group criteria. Patients previously treated with anti-CD38 antibodies are excluded. Patients will receive 10 mg lenalidomide orally continuously during each 28-day cycle. After Cycle 3, if lenalidomide is well tolerated, the dose may be increased to 15 mg per investigator decision. Patients in the daratumumab plus lenalidomide group will receive subcutaneous daratumumab (1,800 mg co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 [rHuPH20; Halozyme]) QW in Cycles 1-2, Q2W in Cycles 3-6, and Q4W thereafter. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal, or for a maximum of 36 cycles. The primary endpoint is the MRD-negativity conversion rate (10ˆ-5 sensitivity threshold) at 12 months, assessed via NGS. MRD will also be assessed at 6, 18, 24, and 36 months. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, overall MRD-negativity rate, durable MRD negativity, rate of complete response or better (≥CR), duration of ≥CR, overall survival, health-related quality of life, and safety.

AB  - Background: New treatments for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma have recently been FDA approved in the United States (US). For FDA approval, these treatments are compared to historic standards of care in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), therefore, limited information regarding safety/efficacy comparisons between newer treatments is available to utilize in comparisons of costs. Aims: We sought to compare the average cost per median month of progression- free survival (PFS) for daratumumab plus bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd) compared with carfilzomib plus dexamethasone (Kd) in patients who have received at least one prior line of therapy. Methods: PFS for DVd was estimated via parametric survival analysis of patient-level data from the CASTOR RCT. PFS for Kd was estimated by applying the PFS hazard ratio (HR) for DVd vs. Kd (HR=0.59), calculated through a network meta-analysis (NMA), to the best-fit DVd PFS curve. Treatment duration was estimated by applying the ratio of median duration of treatment and reported median PFS from the trials to the median PFS calculated via the survival analysis and NMA. HRs, dosing amounts, dosing schedules, relative dose intensity, and adverse event (AE) incidence were extracted from the CASTOR and ENDEAVOR RCTs. Wholesale acquisition costs and administration costs were based on standard US sources. AE costs were sourced from published literature. Results:Median PFS estimates from the analysis for DVd and Kd were 16.9 and 10.0 months, respectively. Total costs were similar between the two treatments. However, average cost per median month of PFS was lower for DVd than for Kd. Results are presented in Table 1. Summary/Conclusion: Based on this analysis, average monthly cost per median month of PFS is lower for DVd compared to Kd in the treatment of multiple myeloma patients with at least one prior line of therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Standard-of-care treatment for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma includes combination therapies for patients who are not eligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation. At the primary analysis for progression-free survival of the phase 3 ALCYONE trial, progression-free survival was significantly longer with daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (D-VMP) versus bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (VMP) alone in patients with transplant-ineligible, newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Here we report updated efficacy and safety results from a prespecified, interim, overall survival analysis of ALCYONE with more than 36 months of follow-up. METHODS: ALCYONE was a multicentre, randomised, open-label, active-controlled, phase 3 trial that enrolled patients between Feb 9, 2015, and July 14, 2016, at 162 sites in 25 countries across North America, South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation, because of their age (≥65 years) or because of substantial comorbidities. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio and by permuted block randomisation to receive D-VMP or VMP. An interactive web-based randomisation system was used. Randomisation was stratified by International Staging System disease stage, geographical region, and age. There was no masking to treatment assignments. All patients received up to nine 6-week cycles of subcutaneous bortezomib (1·3 mg/m(2) of body surface area on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, and 32 of cycle one and on days 1, 8, 22, and 29 of cycles two through nine), oral melphalan (9 mg/m(2) once daily on days 1 through 4 of each cycle), and oral prednisone (60 mg/m(2) once daily on days 1 through 4 of each cycle). Patients in the D-VMP group also received intravenous daratumumab (16 mg/kg of bodyweight, once weekly during cycle one, once every 3 weeks in cycles two through nine, and once every 4 weeks thereafter as maintenance therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, which has been reported previously. Results presented are from a prespecified interim analysis for overall survival. The primary analysis population (including for overall survival) was the intention-to-treat population of all patients who were randomly assigned to treatment. The safety population included patients who received any dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02195479. FINDINGS: 706 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (350 to the D-VMP group, 356 to the VMP group). At a median follow-up of 40·1 months (IQR 37·4-43·1), a significant benefit in overall survival was observed for the D-VMP group. The hazard ratio (HR) for death in the D-VMP group compared with the VMP group was 0·60 (95% CI 0·46-0·80; p=0·0003). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the 36-month rate of overall survival was 78·0% (95% CI 73·2-82·0) in the D-VMP group and 67·9% (62·6-72·6) in the VMP group. Progression-free survival, the primary endpoint, remained significantly improved for the D-VMP group (HR 0·42 [0·34-0·51]; p<0·0001). The most frequent adverse events during maintenance daratumumab monotherapy in patients in the D-VMP group were respiratory infections (54 [19%] of 278 patients had upper respiratory tract infections; 42 [15%] had bronchitis, 34 [12%] had viral upper respiratory tract infections), cough (34 [12%]), and diarrhoea (28 [10%]). INTERPRETATION: D-VMP prolonged overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were ineligible for stem-cell transplantation. With more than 3 years of follow-up, the D-VMP group continued to show significant improvement in progression-free survival, with no new safety concerns. FUNDING: Janssen Research & Development.

AB  - Background: Based on the results of the VISTA study (San Miguel JF et al. NEJM 2008), VMP is considered a standard of care for newly diagnosed patients with MM not considered suitable for high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation (SCT). DARA is a human anti-CD38 IgG1 monoclonal antibody in clinical development for MM. DARA has shown promising efficacy and a favorable safety profile in ongoing phase I/II studies as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy (lenalidomide/dexamethasone) in patients with relapsed or relapsed, refractory MM (Lokhorst HM et al. ASCO 2014; Plesner T et al. ASH 2014) as well as in combination with VMP in newly diagnosed MM (Moreau P et al. ASH 2014). Methods: This is a phase III randomized, open-label, multicenter study of VMP versus DARA + VMP in patients aged 18 y with previously untreated MM who are ineligible for high-dose therapy. Main inclusion criteria are documented MM satisfying the CRAB criteria, measurable disease, and newly diagnosed and not considered a candidate for high-dose chemotherapy with SCT. Approximately 700 eligible patients will be stratified by International Scoring System, region (Europe vs others), and age ( < 75 vs 75 y) and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to VMP or DARA + VMP. All patients will receive up to 9 cycles (1 cycle = 6 wk) of VMP (bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 SC twice weekly [Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5] in Cycle 1, then once weekly [Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5] in Cycles 2-9; melphalan 9 mg/m2 and prednisone 60 mg/m2 PO Day 1-4 of each cycle). Patients in the DARA + VMP arm will receive DARA 16 mg/kg IV weekly x 6 wk (Cycle 1), then every 3 wk for Cycles 2-9; patients will then continue to receive DARA every 4 wk until progression. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). An Independent Data Monitoring Committee will conduct reviews of the efficacy and safety data. The primary analysis will occur when approximately 360 PFS events have been observed. Approximately 200 sites in 24 countries will participate.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone is a standard treatment for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation. Daratumumab has shown efficacy in combination with standard-of-care regimens in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 706 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were ineligible for stem-cell transplantation to receive nine cycles of bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone either alone (control group) or with daratumumab (daratumumab group) until disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 16.5 months in a prespecified interim analysis, the 18-month progression-free survival rate was 71.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.5 to 76.8) in the daratumumab group and 50.2% (95% CI, 43.2 to 56.7) in the control group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.65; P<0.001). The overall response rate was 90.9% in the daratumumab group, as compared with 73.9% in the control group (P<0.001), and the rate of complete response or better (including stringent complete response) was 42.6%, versus 24.4% (P<0.001). In the daratumumab group, 22.3% of the patients were negative for minimal residual disease (at a threshold of 1 tumor cell per 10(5) white cells), as compared with 6.2% of those in the control group (P<0.001). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were hematologic: neutropenia (in 39.9% of the patients in the daratumumab group and in 38.7% of those in the control group), thrombocytopenia (in 34.4% and 37.6%, respectively), and anemia (in 15.9% and 19.8%, respectively). The rate of grade 3 or 4 infections was 23.1% in the daratumumab group and 14.7% in the control group; the rate of treatment discontinuation due to infections was 0.9% and 1.4%, respectively. Daratumumab-associated infusion-related reactions occurred in 27.7% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were ineligible for stem-cell transplantation, daratumumab combined with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone resulted in a lower risk of disease progression or death than the same regimen without daratumumab. The daratumumab-containing regimen was associated with more grade 3 or 4 infections. (Funded by Janssen Research and Development; ALCYONE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02195479 .).

AB  - Introduction VMP is a standard of care (SOC) for transplant ineligible NDMM. Daratumumab (D), a human IgGκ anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody with a direct ontumor and multifaceted immunomodulatory mechanism of action significantly improves PFS and depth of response in combination with SOC in relapsed MM. Treatment-naïve pts may benefit greatly with the addition of D to SOC regimens. Here we report the results from the ALCYONE study, where D is added to VMP in transplant ineligible NDMM. Methods Pts ≥65 years or otherwise ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation were randomized 1:1 to VMP ± D and stratified by International Staging System (ISS [I, II, III]), region (Europe vs other) and age (<75 vs ≥75 years). All pts received up to a maximum of nine 6-week cycles of VMP. V: 1.3 mg/m SC on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, 32 (Cycle 1) and Days 1, 8, 22, and 29 (Cycles 2-9); M: 9 mg/m PO and P: 60 mg/m PO on Days 1-4 (Cycles 1-9). In the D-VMP arm, D was given at 16 mg/kg IV QW for Cycle 1, Q3W for Cycles 2-9, and Q4W for Cycles 10+ (post VMP-treatment phase) until disease progression. The primary endpoint was PFS. Key secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), rate of very good partial response (VGPR) or better, rate of complete response (CR) or better, minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity rate (10 threshold, Adaptive clonoSEQ Assay), overall survival (OS), and safety. Results Of 706 pts randomized (350 D-VMP; 356 VMP), median (range) age was 71 (40-93) years; 29.9% were ≥75 years; 46.3% were male. 74.9% of pts had ECOG scores ≥1, and 19.3%, 42.4%, and 38.4% were ISS stage I, II, and III, respectively. Of 616 pts evaluable for FISH/karyotyping cytogenetic analysis, 84.1% and 15.9% were standard and high risk (positive for del17p, t[14;16], t[4;14]), respectively. At the timepoint of the prespecified analysis after 231 PFS events on 12 June 2017, pts had received a median (range) of 12 (1-24) vs 9 (1-9) treatment cycles for D-VMP vs VMP, respectively. 80% of pts in the D-VMP arm completed 9 treatment cycles of VMP vs 62% of pts in the VMP arm. Median (range) cumulative bortezomib doses were 46.9 (1.3-55.3) mg/m vs 42.2 (2.6-55.0) mg/m for D-VMP vs VMP, respectively. At a median follow-up of 16.5 months, the hazard ratio for PFS (D-VMP vs VMP) was 0.50 (95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.65, P <0.0001), representing a 50% reduction in the risk of progression or death in pts treated with D-VMP (Figure). Median PFS was not reached vs 18.1 months for D-VMP vs VMP. The PFS treatment benefit of D-VMP vs VMP was consistent across all pre-specified subgroups, including age ≥75 years, ISS stage III, and high-risk cytogenetics. ORR (90.9% vs 73.9%), ≥VGPR (71.1% vs 49.7%), ≥CR (42.6% vs 24.4%) and MRD-negativity rate (22.3% vs 6.2%) were significantly higher for D-VMP vs VMP (all P < 0.0001; Table). OS data were immature after 93 deaths (45 vs 48 deaths for D-VMP vs VMP). The most common (≥20%) all-grade treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE; D-VMP/VMP) were neutropenia (49.7%/52.5%), thrombocytopenia (48.8%/53.7%), anemia (28.0%/37.6%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (28.3%/34.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (26.3%/13.8%), diarrhea (23.7%/24.6%), pyrexia (23.1%/20.9%), and nausea (20.8%/21.5%). Most common (≥10%) grade 3/4 TEAEs (D-VMP/VMP) were neutropenia (39.9%/38.7%), thrombocytopenia (34.4%/37.6%), anemia (15.9%/19.8%), and pneumonia (11.3%/4.0%). Only 1 pt in each arm discontinued treatment due to pneumonia. The rates of grade 3/4 infections were 23.1% vs 14.7% and treatment discontinuations due to infections were 0.9% vs 1.4% for DVMP vs VMP. D-associated infusion-related reactions (27.7%) mostly were grade 1/2 (grade 3/4, 4.3%/0.6%) and most (92.7%) occurred during the first infusion. Tumor lysis syndrome occurred in <1% of pts in each arm. Second primary malignancy occurred in 2.3% vs 2.5% pts in D-VMP vs VMP. Conclusion The combination of D with VMP in transplant ineligible NDMM pts doubled the PFS (HR 0.50), which was driven by more pts a hieving deep responses, including significantly higher ≥CR rate and tripling of the MRD-negativity rate. No new safety signals were observed when combining D with VMP. Three phase 3 studies have now demonstrated a consistent doubling of PFS and more than threefold increase in MRD-negativity rate when combining D with SOC regimens. These results support the use of a D-based combination, D-VMP, in transplant ineligible NDMM (Figure presented).

AB  - Introduction: Daratumumab is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody targeting the plasma cell antigen, CD38, that demonstrated significant activity in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd) compared with bortezomib and dexamethasone alone (Vd) in a prespecified interim analysis of CASTOR, a randomized phase 3 study of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM; Palumbo A. N Engl J Med 2016; in press). In this abstract, we report on subgroup analyses according to the number of prior lines of therapy received, and include outcomes based on cytogenetic status, in order to identify the patient population who derived the most benefit from the DVd combination. Methods: Eligible patients (pts) received at least 1 prior line of therapy and were randomized (1:1) to 8 cycles (q3w) of Vd with or without daratumumab (16 mg/kg IV qw in Cycles 1-3, Day 1 of Cycles 4-8, then q4w until progression). For each cycle, bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 SC was administered on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11, and dexamethasone 20 mg PO was given on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Numbers of prior lines of therapy were determined by the site investigator according to the IMWG consensus guidelines. High-risk cytogenetic status based on local laboratory assessments was defined as having at least one of the following abnormalities via karyotyping or fluorescence in-situ hybridization: del17p, t(4;14), or t(14;16). Minimal residual disease (MRD) was evaluated on bone marrow aspirate samples that had been prepared with Ficoll using three different thresholds (10 , 10 , and 10 ) based on the ClonoSEQ assay (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA, USA). Results: Median follow-up was 7.4 months. In the 1 to 3 prior lines (1-3 PL) subgroup (DVd, n=229; Vd, n=219), PFS was significantly longer with DVd vs Vd (median: not reached [NR] vs 7.3 mo; HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.28-0.55; P<0.0001); estimated 12-month PFS rates were 62.2% vs 29.3%, respectively. Median time to progression (TTP) among 1-3 PL pts was NR vs 7.4 months, respectively (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.20-0.43; P<0.0001). Overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher with DVd vs Vd (84% vs 67%; P<0.0001) and was associated with higher rates of very good partial response (VGPR) or better (62% vs 32%; P<0.0001). Among 1-3 PL pts with standard-risk cytogenetic status, PFS was significantly prolonged in DVd vs Vd (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.25-0.58; P<0.0001), and estimated 12-month PFS rates were 58.7% vs 27.0%, respectively. PFS was also significantly longer in pts with high-risk cytogenetics who received DVd vs Vd (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22-0.97; P=0.0367; Figure), with estimated 12-month PFS rates of 63.2% vs 26.7%, respectively. Lastly, the rate of MRD-negative patients was significantly higher (4 fold or greater) at all evaluated thresholds (10-4 , 10-5 , and 10-6) among the 1-3 PL subgroup. In the 1 prior line (1 PL) subgroup (DVd, n=122; Vd, n=113), PFS was also significantly improved for DVd vs Vd (median: NR vs 7.5 mo; HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.18-0.52; P<0.0001); estimated 12- month PFS rates were 77.5% vs 29.4%, respectively. Median TTP among 1 PL pts was NR vs 8.4 months, respectively (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.16-0.49; P<0.0001). ORR in pts with 1 PL was significantly higher for DVd vs Vd (89% vs 74%; P=0.0029), including higher rates of VGPR or better being observed for DVd vs Vd (71% vs 42%; P<0.0001). Updated efficacy and safety data, including analyses of MRD status across different sensitivity thresholds (10 , 10 , and 10 ), will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: The treatment benefit of DVd vs Vd was maintained across 1-3 PL and 1 PL pts. Responses for DVd were deep and durable and correlated with significantly improved outcomes vs Vd. Despite small group sizes, treatment benefit of DVd vs Vd was also observed in high-risk cytogenetic pts receiving 1-3 PL. These data continue to support the addition of daratumumab to a standard-of-care regimen in RRMM. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Introduction: In Part 1 of the phase 3 CASSIOPEIA study, patients (pts) received D-VTd or bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone (VTd) as pre-autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) induction (four 28-day cycles) and post-ASCT consolidation therapy (two 28-day cycles). D-VTd improved progression-free survival (PFS) and rates of stringent complete response (sCR) and minimal residual disease-negativity rate vs VTd. In Part 2 (ongoing), pts were re-randomized to D maintenance or observation for 2 years. In the phase 3 IFM 2005-01 study, pts received vincristine-doxorubicin-dexamethasone (VAd) induction (four 28-day cycles) with or without dexamethasone-cyclophosphamide-etoposide-cisplatin (dCEP) consolidation (two 28-day cycles), or Vd induction (four 21-day cycles) with or without dCEP consolidation therapy; all pts with a partial response or better post-ASCT were randomized (1:1) to receive lenalidomide maintenance or placebo until relapse. Vd induction improved median PFS and overall response rate compared with VAd induction; response rates were similar with and without dCEP consolidation. As indirect naive comparisons may introduce bias due to differences in patient populations, we compared relative differences in efficacy outcomes (PFS and OS) for D-VTd or VTd+ASCT vs Vd+ASCT using an unanchored MAIC. Methods: In each analysis, a naïve comparison without adjustments and MAIC were performed. The MAIC weighted individual D-VTd or VTd pts in CASSIOPEIA (based on propensity scores) to matched published summary baseline characteristics of Vd pts in IMF 2005-01, and weighted outcomes were calculated. Matched characteristics were age, sex, ISS stage, β-2 microglobulin level, cytogenetic profile, hemoglobin level, and serum calcium level. A sensitivity analysis was performed that also matched pts on creatinine level. IFM2005-01 patient level OS and PFS data were generated by the Guyot algorithm. Results: A total of 543 D-VTd and 542 VTd pts in CASSIOPEIA and 240 Vd pts in IFM 2005-01 were treated. After matching, all baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment arms. Naive comparisons of PFS and OS were all significantly in favor of D-VTd vs Vd. After matching, PFS and OS were also significantly in favor of D-VTd vs Vd. D-VTd performed significantly better than Vd for PFS (HR, 0.42 [95% CI: 0.28-0.63], P<0.0001) and OS (HR, 0.38 [95% CI: 0.18-0.77], P=0.0072). The sensitivity analysis including baseline creatinine level showed similar significant results for PFS and OS, although these results should be interpreted with caution due to a marked reduction in effective sample size, immaturity of data in the D-VTd arm, and presence of outliers. Naïve comparisons and MAICs showed that PFS and OS were not significantly different for VTd vs Vd. Conclusion: In this MAIC, D-VTd+ASCT from CASSIOPEIA significantly improved PFS and OS compared with Vd+ASCT from IFM2005-01 for pts with NDMM who were TE, although the CASSIOPEIA OS data remain immature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (VTd) plus autologous stem-cell transplantation is standard treatment in Europe for transplant-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. We evaluated whether the addition of daratumumab to VTd before and after autologous stem-cell transplantation would improve stringent complete response rate in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. METHODS: In this two-part, randomised, open-label, phase 3 CASSIOPEIA trial, we recruited transplant-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma at 111 European sites. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive four pre-transplant induction and two post-transplant consolidation cycles of VTd alone (VTd group) or in combination with daratumumab (D-VTd group). The primary endpoint of part 1 was stringent complete response assessed 100 days after transplantation. Part 2 (maintenance) is ongoing. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02541383. FINDINGS: Between Sept 22, 2015, and Aug 1, 2017, 1085 patients were enrolled at 111 European sites and were randomly assigned to the D-VTd group (n=543) or the VTd group (n=542). At day 100 after transplantation, 157 (29%) of 543 patients in the D-VTd group and 110 (20%) of 542 patients in the VTd group in the intention-to-treat population had achieved a stringent complete response (odds ratio 1·60, 95% CI 1·21-2·12, p=0·0010). 211 (39%) patients in the D-VTd group versus 141 (26%) in the VTd group achieved a complete response or better, and 346 (64%) of 543 versus 236 (44%) of 542 achieved minimal residual disease-negativity (10(-5) sensitivity threshold, assessed by multiparametric flow cytometry; both p<0·0001). Median progression-free survival from first randomisation was not reached in either group (hazard ratio 0·47, 95% CI 0·33-0·67, p<0·0001). 46 deaths on study were observed (14 vs 32, 0·43, 95% CI 0·23-0·80). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (28% vs 15%), lymphopenia (17% vs 10%), and stomatitis (13% vs 16%). INTERPRETATION: D-VTd before and after autologous stem-cell transplantation improved depth of response and progression-free survival with acceptable safety. CASSIOPEIA is the first study showing the clinical benefit of daratumumab plus standard of care in transplant-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

AB  - Background: VTd is a standard of care (SoC) for TE NDMM. CD38 mAb DARA significantly reduced the risk of progression/death and improved CR and MRD-negative rates in relapsed refractory MM or transplant-ineligible NDMM in phase 3 studies. We report the primary and final analysis of Part 1 of CASSIOPEIA. Methods:In Part 1, TE NDMM pts 18-65 y were randomized 1:1 to VTd (6 28-day cycles [C; 4 pre-ASCT induction, 2 post-ASCT consolidation] of V 1.3 mg/m2 SC BIW Week [W] 1-2; T 100 mg PO QD; d 40-80 mg/week PO or IV W 1-4 C 1-2, W 1-3 C 3-6) ± DARA (16 mg/kg IV QW C 1-2, Q2W C 3-6). Melphalan 200 mg/m2was pre-ASCT HDT. The primary endpoint, post-consolidation sCR rate, was assessed at Day [D] 100 post-ASCT. Part 2 (maintenance) is ongoing. Results: A cohort of 1085 pts (D-VTd, 543; VTd, 542) was randomized. The D 100 post-ASCT sCR rate was significantly higher for D-VTd vs VTd (28.9% vs 20.3%; P = 0.0010; Table). At 18.8-mo median follow-up, PFS from first randomization favored D-VTd with HR 0.47 (95% CI, 0.33-0.67; P<0.0001). With median PFS NR in either arm, 18-mo PFS rates were 92.7% vs 84.6% for D-VTd vs VTd. Rates of ≥CR, ≥VGPR, and MRD negativity supported sCR results (Table). OS is immature with 46 deaths on study (D-VTd, 14; VTd, 32; HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23-0.80). The most common (≥10%) grade 3/4 TEAEs (D-VTd/VTd) were neutropenia (27.6%/14.7%), lymphopenia (17.0%/9.7%), stomatitis (12.7%/16.4%), and thrombocytopenia (11.0%/7.4%). In the D-VTd arm, infusion-related reactions occurred in 35.4% of pts. Conclusions: D-VTd in induction prior to and consolidation after ASCT improved depth of response (sCR, ≥CR, and MRD negativity) and PFS with acceptable safety. The favorable benefit-risk profile supports the use of D-VTd in TE NDMM. CASSIOPEIA is the first study to demonstrate clinical benefit of DARA + SoC in TE NDMM.

AB  - Introduction: For patients (pts) with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who are transplant-eligible, VTd with autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is a standard of care. In the PETHEMA/GEM study, pts in the VTd group received pre-ASCT induction therapy (six 28-day cycles) of bortezomib, thalidomide (ramp up to 200 mg daily, per label), and dexamethasone, followed by post-ASCT maintenance (up to 3 years) of interferon alfa-2b, thalidomide (100 mg daily), or thalidomide (100 mg daily) with bortezomib (1 cycle every 3 months; Rosiñol L, et al. Blood. 2012;120[8]:1589-96). Clinical practice has evolved and a modified thalidomide daily dose of 100 mg instead of 200 mg is now the standard of care (Mohty M, et al., presented at EBMT 2019, abstract OS12-3) and is reflected in treatment guidelines. In the phase 3 CASSIOPEIA study (part 1), pts received pre-ASCT induction (four 28-day cycles) and post-ASCT consolidation therapy (two 28-day cycles) of VTd (thalidomide 100 mg daily; VTd-mod) without or with daratumumab (D-VTd). In CASSIOPEIA part 2 (ongoing), pts with a partial response or better were re-randomized to maintenance therapy of daratumumab or observation (up to 2 years; Moreau P, et al. Lancet. 2019;394[10192]:29-38). Here, we used PSM to estimate the effect of treatments by controlling for differences in baseline covariates. We evaluated efficacy and safety in treatment groups from CASSIOPEIA versus the VTd group from PETHEMA/GEM (VTd-label). Methods: Patient-level data for VTd-label were from PETHEMA/GEM, and VTd-mod and D-VTd were from CASSIOPEIA. Propensity scores were estimated using logistic regression. Pre-and post-match balance between groups was assessed using standardized differences for included covariates. The near neighbor matching procedure was used for matching. Covariates for matching were age, sex, ECOG performance status, myeloma type, International Staging System (ISS) disease stage, creatinine clearance, hemoglobin level, and platelet count. Outcomes observed in the matched sample were compared directly using a suitable measure of treatment effect for different endpoints. Outcomes of interest were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR) post-induction and post-ASCT, and rate of grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy. Results: Pts received VTd-mod (n=542), D-VTd (n=543) and VTd-label (n=130). After matching, 250 pts each for VTd-mod and D-VTd and 125 pts for VTd-label were included in the analyses. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups after matching. For OS and PFS, the comparison on matched samples demonstrated that VTd-mod was non-inferior to VTd-label (OS hazard ratio [HR] 0.573 [95% CI: 0.286-1.146], P=0.115; PFS HR 0.781 [95% CI: 0.522-1.168], P=0.229), and D-VTd was significantly better than VTd-label (OS HR 0.176 [95% CI: 0.065-0.477], P=0.001; PFS HR 0.296 [95% CI: 0.177-0.493], P<0.0001; Figure). Post-induction, the ORR for VTd-mod was non-inferior to VTdlabel (odds ratio [OR] 1.314 [95% CI: 0.698-2.426], P=0.387). Post-transplant, VTd-mod demonstrated significantly better ORR versus VTd-label (OR 2.374 [95% CI: 1.316-4.292], P=0.004). D-VTd was significantly better than VTd-label for both post-induction and post-transplant ORRs (post-induction OR, 2.061 [95% CI: 1.050-4.036] P=0.034; post-transplant OR, 3.004 [95% CI: 1.626-5.624], P<0.0001). Compared with VTd-label, rates of grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy were non-inferior for both VTdmod (rate difference, 1.2 [95% CI: -3.9-6.3], P=0.655) and D-VTd (rate difference, -2.8 [95% CI: -7.32-1.72]; P=0.186). Conclusion: In this PSM analysis, non-inferiority of VTd-mod versus VTd-label was demonstrated for OS, PFS, post-induction ORR, and grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy; VTd-mod was significantly better for post-transplant ORR. D-VTd was significantly better than VTd-label for OS, PFS, postinduction ORR, and post-transplant ORR, and was non-inferior to VTd-label for rates of grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy. OS results for VTd-mod and D-VTd should be interpreted with the cavea that CASSIOPEIA OS data remain immature. These findings confirm those of CASSIOPEIA: D-VTd had superior efficacy versus VTd, both of which used a modified thalidomide dose. Potential imitations include unobserved confounding factors, and differences in study design (eg, response criteria and maintenance therapy).

AB  - Introduction: Daratumumab is an anti-CD38 IgGκ monoclonal antibody that has been combined successfully with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. The combination of daratumumab with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd) has been compared with lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (Rd) in patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) in a randomized phase 3 study (Dimopoulos MA, et al. N Engl J Med 2016; in press). In a prespecified interim analysis, the DRd combination demonstrated significantly longer progressionfree survival (PFS) in addition to deep and durable responses compared with the Rd arm. We performed subgroup analyses to further examine these efficacy data according to prior treatment exposure. Methods: Pts who received ≥1 prior line of therapy were randomized (1:1) to Rd (lenalidomide: 25 mg PO on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle; dexamethasone: 40 mg PO weekly) with or without daratumumab (16 mg/kg IV qw for 8 weeks, q2w for 16 weeks, then q4w until progression). The primary endpoint was PFS. Pts who were refractory to lenalidomide were not eligible. All analyses were performed in pts who received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy. Results: Median follow-up was 13.5 months. Pts who were lenalidomide-naive prior to the start of study treatment (DRd, n=226; Rd, n=219) demonstrated significantly longer PFS with DRd vs Rd (median: not reached [NR] vs 18.4 months; HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.25-0.52; P<0.0001), with estimated 12-month PFS rates of 83.0% vs 59.9%, respectively. ORR was significantly higher with DRd vs Rd (96% vs 79%), with ≥VGPR rates of 76% vs 47% and ≥CR rates of 44% vs 21%, respectively (P<0.0001 for all). In the lenalidomide-exposed subgroup (DRd, n=46; Rd, n=45), median PFS was NR in both treatment groups (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.22-1.12; P=0.0826); estimated 12-month PFS rates were 84.1% vs 63.1%, respectively. ORR was higher with DRd vs Rd but did not reach statistical significance (87% vs 71%; P=0.0729); however, rates of ≥VGPR (78% vs 38%; P=0.0001) and ≥CR (44% vs 12%; P=0.0011) were significantly improved with DRd vs Rd, respectively. For bortezomib-naive pts (DRd, n=44; Rd, n=45), PFS was significantly longer with DRd vs Rd (median: NR vs 15.8 months; HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.13-0.86; P=0.0170), with estimated 12-month PFS rates of 85.4% vs 69.2%, respectively. ORR was significantly higher with DRd vs Rd (98% vs 82%; P=0.0158), with trends toward increased rates of ≥VGPR (74% vs 55%; P=0.0544) and ≥CR (42% vs 23%; P=0.0576). In the bortezomib-exposed pts (DRd, n=228; Rd, n=219), median PFS was NR in DRd vs 18.4 months in Rd (HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.24-0.50 P<0.0001); estimated 12- month PFS rates were 82.8% vs 58.7%, respectively. Significant differences in ORR (93% vs 77%), rate of ≥VGPR (77% vs 43%) and rate of ≥CR (44% vs 19%) were observed with DRd vs Rd, respectively (P<0.0001 for all). Among bortezomib-refractory patients (DRd, n=54; Rd, n=49), the PFS benefit of DRd compared with Rd was maintained (median: NR vs 10.3 mo, respectively; HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25- 0.85; P=0.0117; Figure). The estimated 12-month PFS rates were 70.8% vs 44.4%, respectively. Similar to bortezomib-exposed pts, ORR (92% vs 68%; P=0.0024), rate of ≥VGPR (75% vs 36%; P=0.0001), and rate of ≥CR (46% vs 13%; P=0.0003) were all significantly higher with DRd vs Rd for bortezomib-refractory pts. Updated data will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: Among pts who received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy, significantly longer PFS and higher ORR were observed with DRd vs Rd among pts who previously received bortezomib or were refractory to bortezomib or were lenalidomide-naive. Higher rates of deeper responses were observed in pts who previously received lenalidomide or bortezomib. Follow-up is ongoing to assess PFS in pts who received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy and previously received lenalidomide. These results further strengthen the significant benefit of combining daratumumab with Rd for RRMM. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Introduction: Daratumumab is a CD38-targeting human IgGκ monoclonal antibody with a direct on-tumor and immunomodulatory mechanism of action. In combination with a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib) or an immunomodulatory drug (lenalidomide or pomalidomide), daratumumab induces rapid, deep, and durable responses in patients with RRMM (Palumbo A, et al. N Engl J Med 2016. 375(8):754-766; Dimopoulos MA, et al. N Engl J Med 2016. 375(14):1319-1331; Chari A, et al. Blood 2017. Epub ahead of print). This analysis reports updated efficacy data within clinically relevant subgroups of DRd versus Rd in POLLUX. Methods: Patients with ≥1 prior line of therapy were randomized (1:1) to receive Rd (lenalidomide: 25 mg PO on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle; dexamethasone: 40 mg PO weekly) with or without daratumumab (16 mg/kg IV weekly for Cycles 1 and 2, q2w for Cycles 3-6, then q4w until disease progression). Patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <30 mL/min were excluded from the study. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). The number of prior lines of therapy was determined by the site investigator and was based on IMWG consensus guidelines (Rajkumar SV, et al. Blood 2011. 117(18):4691-4695). Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed on bone marrow aspirates at the time of suspected complete response (CR) and 3 and 6 months after-suspected CR using the ClonoSEQ™ next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay (V. 1.3; Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA) at sensitivity thresholds of 10-4, 10-5, and 10-6. Patients were considered to be MRD positive if they had a MRD positive test result or had no MRD assessment. Cytogenetic abnormalities were detected by NGS. Patients with high-risk cytogenetics had ≥1 of t(4;14), t(14;16), or del17p abnormalities; standard-risk patients were confirmed to be negative for these abnormalities. Results: A total of 569 patients were enrolled in POLLUX and baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment arms. At a median follow-up of 25.4 months, PFS was significantly prolonged with DRd versus Rd, regardless of the number of prior lines of therapy (1, 2-3, or 1-3; Table). The PFS benefit was maintained in patients who previously received lenalidomide (median: not reached [NR] vs 18.6 months; 24-month PFS rate: 69% vs 41%; HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16-0.64; P= 0.0008; Figure 1A), were refractory to bortezomib (median: 26.1 vs 11.3 months; HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26-0.80; P= 0.0051; Figure 1B), had moderately impaired renal function (>30-60 mL/min;median: NR vs 11.4 months; 24-month PFS rate: 63% vs 29%; HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.22-0.60; P <0.0001), or had received prior autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT; median: NR vs 19.9 months; 24-month PFS rate: 63% vs 45%; HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.36-0.69; P <0.0001). Patients who received DRd achieved significantly higher overall response rates (ORRs) compared with Rd, including increased rates of very good partial response (VGPR) or better and CR or better, respectively, regardless of the number of prior lines of therapy (Table). ORRs were higher for DRd versus Rd among patients who previously received lenalidomide (84% vs 64%; P= 0.0233), were refractory to bortezomib (88% vs 68%; P= 0.0113), had impaired renal function (91% vs 68%; P= 0.0008), or had received prior ASCT (92% vs 79%; P=0.0004). In terms of cytogenetic risk, the PFS benefit was maintained for DRd versus Rd in high (median 22.6 vs 10.2 months; HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.25-1.13; P= 0.0921) and standard risk (median NR vs 18.5 months; 24-month PFS rate: 74% vs 40%; HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.20-0.47; P <0.0001) patients. Patients who received DRd achieved higher ORRs compared with Rd in both the high-risk (85% vs 67%; P= 0.0435) and standard-risk (95% vs 82%; P= 0.0004) groups. A higher percentage of patients achieved MRD-negative status with DRd vs Rd, regardless of cytogenetic risk (high risk: 21% vs 0%, P= 0.0009; standard risk: 32% vs 12%, P= 0.0001). Updated data will be presented at the meeting. Conclusion: This updated analysis reveals that DRd provided clinical benefit to patients reg rdless of prior treatment history, cytogenetic risk or moderate renal impairment. This analysis demonstrates that DRd should be considered after lenalidomide-based therapies in patients with RRMM, including those refractory to bortezomib. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Background: Daratumumab (D), a human anti-CD38 IgGκ monoclonal antibody, induces deep and durable responses with a favorable safety profile in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). We report a pre-specified interim analysis of the first randomised controlled study of daratumumab (CASTOR; NCT02136134). Aims: To compare the efficacy and safety of daratumumab plus bortezomib (V) and dexamethasone (d) versus Vd alone in patients with RRMM in a phase 3 study. Methods: Patients who received ≥1 prior line of therapy were randomised (1:1) to 8 cycles (q3w) of Vd (bortezomib: 1.3 mg/m2 subcutaneously on Days 1, 4, 8, 11; dexamethasone: 20 mg orally on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12) with or without daratumumab (16 mg/kg intravenously qw in Cycles 1-3, Day 1 of Cycles 4-8, then q4w until progression). The primary endpoint was progression- free survival (PFS). Results: 498 patients (DVd, 251; Vd, 247) were randomised. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced. Patients received a median of 2 prior lines of therapy (range 1-10). 66% received prior bortezomib; 76% received prior immunomodulatory drug (IMiD); 48% received prior proteasome inhibitor (PI) and IMiD; 33% were IMiD-refractory; and 32% were refractory to last line of prior therapy. With a median follow-up of 7.4 months, daratumumab significantly improved median PFS (61% reduction in the risk of progression/death) for DVd versus Vd (Figure 1). Addition of daratumumab to Vd also significantly delayed median time to disease progression (TTP) versus Vd (not reached [NR] vs 7.3 mo; hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.43; P <0.0001). Daratumumab significantly increased overall response rate (ORR; 83% vs 63%, P <0.0001), in addition to doubling the rates of very good partial responses (VGPR) or better (59% vs 29%, P <0.0001) and complete responses (CR) or better (19% vs 9%, P = 0.0012) for DVd versus Vd, respectively. The median duration of response was NR for DVd versus 7.9 months for Vd. All planned sensitivity analyses demonstrated that DVd was better than Vd, which was consistent with the results from the primary analysis. In addition, pre-specified subgroup analyses on PFS demonstrated that the treatment effect of DVd over Vd was consistent across all selected subgroups. Most common (>25%) treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; DVd/Vd) were thrombocytopenia (59%/44%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (47%/ 38%), diarrhoea (32%/22%) and anaemia (26%/31%). Most common grade 3/4 TEAEs (>10%) were thrombocytopenia (45%/33%), anaemia (14%/16%), neutropenia (13%/4%). 7%/9% (DVd/Vd) of patients discontinued due to a TEAE. Daratumumab-associated infusion-related reactions (IRR; 45% of patients) mostly occurred during the first infusion (98% of patients with IRR); most were grade 1/2 (grade 3/4, 9%/0%). Summary/Conclusions: Daratumumab significantly improved PFS, TTP, and ORR in combination with Vd versus Vd alone. DVd doubled rates of both VGPR or better and stringent CR/CR versus Vd alone. Safety of DVd is consistent with the known safety profile of daratumumab and Vd. The addition of daratumumab to Vd should be considered a new standard of care for patients with RRMM currently receiving Vd alone. (Figure Presented).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Daratumumab, a human IgGκ monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, induces direct and indirect antimyeloma activity and has shown substantial efficacy as monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with multiple myeloma, as well as in combination with bortezomib in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 498 patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma to receive bortezomib (1.3 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and dexamethasone (20 mg) alone (control group) or in combination with daratumumab (16 mg per kilogram of body weight) (daratumumab group). The primary end point was progression-free survival. RESULTS: A prespecified interim analysis showed that the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group; the 12-month rate of progression-free survival was 60.7% in the daratumumab group versus 26.9% in the control group. After a median follow-up period of 7.4 months, the median progression-free survival was not reached in the daratumumab group and was 7.2 months in the control group (hazard ratio for progression or death with daratumumab vs. control, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.53; P<0.001). The rate of overall response was higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group (82.9% vs. 63.2%, P<0.001), as were the rates of very good partial response or better (59.2% vs. 29.1%, P<0.001) and complete response or better (19.2% vs. 9.0%, P=0.001). Three of the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported in the daratumumab group and the control group were thrombocytopenia (45.3% and 32.9%, respectively), anemia (14.4% and 16.0%, respectively), and neutropenia (12.8% and 4.2%, respectively). Infusion-related reactions that were associated with daratumumab treatment were reported in 45.3% of the patients in the daratumumab group; these reactions were mostly grade 1 or 2 (grade 3 in 8.6% of the patients), and in 98.2% of these patients, they occurred during the first infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone and was associated with infusion-related reactions and higher rates of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone.

AB  - Background: Daratumumab (D), a human antiCD38 IgG mAb, induces deep and durable responses with a favorable safety profile in RRMM pts. We report a prespecified interim analysis of the first randomized controlled study of D (CASTOR; NCT02136134 ). Methods: Pts with 1 prior line of therapy were randomized (1:1) to 8 cycles (q3w) of bortezomib (V)/dexamethasone (d) (V: 1.3 mg/m2sc on Days 1, 4, 8, 11; d: 20 mg po on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12) ± D (16 mg/kg iv qw in Cycles 13, Day 1 of Cycles 48, then q4w until progression). Primary endpoint was PFS. Results: 498 pts (DVd, 251; Vd, 247) were randomized. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced. Pts received a median of 2 prior lines of therapy (range 110). 66% received prior V; 76% received prior IMiD; 48% received prior PI and IMiD; 33% were IMiDrefractory; 32% were refractory to last line of prior therapy. With median followup of 7.4 months, D significantly improved median PFS (61% reduction in risk of progression) and TTP for DVd vs Vd (Table). D significantly increased ORR (83% vs 63%, P <0.0001), and doubled rates of VGPR (59% vs 29%, P <0.0001), and CR (19% vs 9%, P= 0.0012) for DVd vs Vd, respectively; median duration of response was NR vs 7.9 months, respectively. Most common (>25%) AEs (DVd/Vd) were thrombocytopenia (59%/44%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (47%/ 38%), diarrhea (32%/22%) and anemia (26%/31%). Most common grade 3/4 AEs (>10%) were thrombocytopenia (45%/33%), anemia (14%/16%), neutropenia (13%/4%). 7%/9% of pts discontinued due to a TEAE. Dassociated infusionrelated reactions (45% of pts) mostly occurred during the first infusion; most were grade 1/2 (grade 3/4, 9%/0%). Conclusions: D significantly improved PFS, TTP, and ORR in combination with Vd vs Vd alone. DVd doubled both VGPR and sCR/CR rates vs Vd alone. Safety of DVd is consistent with the known safety profile of D and Vd. The addition of D to Vd should be considered a new standard of care for RRMM pts currently receiving Vd alone.

AB  - Objectives: Multiple pomalidomide/dexamethasone-based triplet therapies have been assessed for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), but data from head-to-head randomized trials are not available. Indirect cross-trial assessments can provide a comparison of effectiveness, but are influenced by differing patient populations. We generated ‘virtual trials’ to determine the effectiveness of pomalidomide/dexamethasone in combination with elotuzumab (EPd), carfilzomib (KPd), or daratumumab (DPd) in RRMM. Methods: Unanchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) analyses (Signorovitch 2010) were performed using individual patient data (IPD) from the EPd arm of ELOQUENT-3 (NCT02654132) and summary data from single-arm trials of KPd (NCT01464034) and DPd (EQUULEUS, NCT01998971). IPD from ELOQUENT-3 were re-weighted to match those baseline summary statistics reported for KPd and DPd; treatment outcomes were then compared across balanced trial populations. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox regression. Results: Patients receiving EPd (effective sample: n=44/60) were matched to those receiving KPd (n=32) using time since diagnosis, prior transplant, and refractoriness to both proteasome inhibitors (PIs) and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). Patients receiving EPd (effective sample: n=54/60) were matched to those receiving DPd (n=103) using cytogenetic risk profile, prior lines of therapy, and refractoriness to both PIs and IMiDs. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was numerically higher for EPd versus KPd (10.3 versus 7.3 months, HR=0.671 [95% CI 0.44–1.03], p=0.08) and similar for EPd versus DPd (10.3 versus 9.9 months, HR=0.946 [95% CI 0.63–1.41], p=0.80), although differences were not statistically significant. Sensitivity analyses matching fewer or more variables produced similar findings. Conclusions: This MAIC analysis suggests EPd may be associated with a numerically higher PFS than KPd and a similar PFS to DPd. Relative overall survival will be assessed when long-term survival data are available. These statistical based findings, matching patient characteristics that were available for each trial, are limited by small sample sizes and should be further confirmed by clinical research.

AB  - Background: Daratumumab (D) plus VMP (D-VMP) prolonged progression-free survival compared with VMP and was well-tolerated in the phase 3 ALCYONE study (NCT02195479). Aims: We examined the efficacy and safety profiles of D-VMP vs VMP in elderly (≥75 years of age) and non-elderly (<75 years of age) newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients in ALCYONE. Methods: Patients were 65 years of age or older or otherwise ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation. Patients received up to nine 6-week VMP cycles (V: 1.3 mg/m2 subcutaneously Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, 32 [Cycle 1] and Days 1, 8, 22, 29 [Cycles 2-9]; M: 9 mg/m2 orally and P: 60 mg/m2 orally Days 1-4 [Cycles 1-9]) with or without D (16 mg/kg intravenously QW for Cycle 1, Q3W for Cycles 2-9, and Q4W for Cycles 10+ [post VMP-treatment phase] until progression). Minimal residual disease was assessed by clonoSEQ® assay (Adaptive Biotechnologies). Results: 706 (350 D-VMP; 356 VMP) patients were randomized, including 211 patients ≥75 years of age (104 D-VMP; 107 VMP) and 495 patients <75 years of age (246 D-VMP; 249 VMP). For D-VMP vs VMP, the median duration of study treatment was 14.5 months vs 12.0 months for patients ≥75 years of age and 15.0 months vs 12.0 months for patients <75 years of age, respectively. The cumulative dose of bortezomib was 43.1 mg/m2 and 34.1 mg/m2 with D-VMP and VMP, respectively, for patients ≥75 years of age, and 48.6 mg/m2 and 46.2 mg/m2 with D-VMP and VMP, respectively, for patients <75 years of age. After median follow-up of 16.5 months, progression-free survival was prolonged with D-VMP vs VMP both in patients ≥75 years of age (median not reached [NR] vs 20.4 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32-0.85) and patients <75 years of age (median NR vs 17.9 months; HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.36-0.68). Overall response rate (ORR) and ≥complete response (CR) rates were consistently higher for D-VMP vs VMP in patients ≥75 years of age (ORR: 88% vs 70%; ≥CR: 41% vs 24%) and <75 years of age (ORR: 92% vs 76%; ≥CR: 43% vs 25%). Minimal residual disease-negative rates (10-5threshold) also increased with D-VMP vs VMP in patients ≥75 years of age (24% vs 8%) and <75 years of age (22% vs 6%). Rates of most common grade 3/4 (≥10%) treatment-emergent adverse events, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and infections are presented in the Table 1. D-associated infusion-related reactions were 36% (9% grade 3/4) in patients ≥75 years of age and 24% (3% grade 3/4) in patients <75 years of age. Summary and Conclusions: The efficacy of D-VMP vs VMP in patients ≥75 years of age was consistent with the overall study population. Furthermore, D in combination with VMP demonstrated acceptable tolerability regardless of age. (Table Presented) .

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Background: Daratumumab (D) is a human CD38-targeting monoclonal antibody that exerts its antimyeloma activity through both direct (on-tumor) and indirect (immunomodulatory) mechanisms of action. Two randomized phase 3 trials in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) demonstrated that combining D with the standard-of-care regimens lenalidomide+dexamethasone (Rd, POLLUX) or bortezomib+dexamethasone (Vd, CASTOR) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and achieved higher overall response rates (ORRs) compared with the respective standard-of-care regimen alone (Dimopoulos MA et al., N Engl J Med 2016;375(14):1319-1331; Palumbo A et al., N Engl J Med 2016;375(8):754-766.). Due to its novel mechanisms of action, addition of D to standard-of-care regimens may benefit RRMM patients who have poor prognoses resulting from high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. Aims: To examine the efficacy of DRd and DVd in RRMM patients with standard or high cytogenetic risk status. Methods: Bone marrow aspirates were collected at screening visits from 311/569 patients from POLLUX and from 353/498 patients from CASTOR, and cytogenetic abnormalities were detected via next-generation sequencing (NGS). Patients were considered to be of high cytogenetic risk status if they had ≥1 of the following abnormalities: t(4;14), t(14;16), or del17p; patients were considered to be of standard cytogenetic risk if they lacked these abnormalities. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed at suspected complete response (CR) at 3 sensitivity thresholds (10-4, 10-5, and 10-6) using the ClonoSEQ™ NGS-based assay (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA). Efficacy analyses included PFS, ORR, and MRD-negative rates. Results: For POLLUX, the median follow-up was 17.3 months. Treating highrisk patients with DRd significantly prolonged median PFS vs Rd (top panel Figure 1) and numerically increased ORR (85%vs 67%; P=0.14). Responses to DRd vs Rd included CR or better in 33%vs 6%of these patients, and very good partial responses (VGPR) or better in 63%vs 31%. In standard-risk patients, DRd vs Rd also resulted in significant improvements in median PFS (Figure 1) as well as ORR (95%vs 82%; P=0.0020). Responses to DRd vs Rd included CR or better in 52%vs 24%of these patients, and VGPR or better in 84%vs 51%. At 10-5 sensitivity threshold, MRD-negative rates for DRd vs Rd were 18%vs 0%(P=0.0027) among high-risk patients and 30%vs 10%(P<0.0001) for standard-risk patients. For CASTOR, the median follow-up was 13.0 months. Treating both high-and standard-risk patients with DVd vs Vd significantly prolonged median PFS (bottom panel Figure 1) and increased ORR (high risk: 82%vs 62%; P=0.039; standard risk: 85%vs 64%; P=0.0003). Responses to DVd vs Vd among high-risk patients included CR or better in 30%vs 9%of patients and VGPR or better in 64%vs 34%; among standardrisk patients, responses included CR or better in 25%vs 8%of patients and VGPR or better in 64%vs 27%. At 10-5 sensitivity threshold, MRD-negative rates for DVd vs Vd were 14%vs 0%(P=0.0018) among high-risk patients and 12%vs 2%(P=0.0011) for standard-risk patients.(Figure presented)clusions: Adding D to Rd or Vd improved treatment outcomes irrespective of cytogenetic risk status in patients with RRMM. Both DRd and DVd appear to benefit RRMM patients who have poor prognoses due to highrisk cytogenetic abnormalities. Updated data, including analyses based on individual cytogenetic abnormalities, will be presented at the meeting based on longer follow-up.

AB  - Introduction: In the Southwest Oncology Group trial SWOG S0777 (NCT00644228), lenalidomide (LEN), bortezomib (BORT), and dexamethasone (DEX; RVd) demonstrated superior median progression-free survival (PFS; 43 months vs. 30 months, P = 0.002) and overall survival (OS; 75 months vs. 64 months, P = 0.025) compared with Rd in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) not eligible for immediate autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). This analysis compared the cost-effectiveness of RVd with existing treatment options for Canadian patients with NDMM not intended for ASCT (including LEN and DEX (Rd); and BORT, melphalan, and prednisone [VMP]), and regimens such as daratumumab plus VMP [D-VMP], which is currently Sunder review by the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR). Methods: The natural history of disease was modelled using a partitioned survival analysis and comprised of 3 health states (pre-progression, post-progression, and death). PFS and OS for RVd and Rd were estimated based on analysis of the SWOG S0777 trial data. Survival estimates for VMP and D-VMP were informed by a previously published network meta-analysis (NMA). Although cyclophosphamide, BORT, and DEX (CyBorD) is a commonly used therapy for MM patients in Canada, due to the lack of randomized trial data on its efficacy VMP was used as a proxy. Given the non-proportional hazards for PFS observed between regimens with a fixed duration (e.g. VMP) and those used until progression (e.g. Rd), a piecewise model was fit to the PFS data from the MM-020 trial comparing melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide (MPT) and Rd, and hazard ratios (HR) from the NMA for VMP and D-VMP were applied to MPT. The OS curve for VMP was generated by applying the published HR to the modelled Rd arm. Given the paucity of OS data for D-VMP, this was assumed to be equivalent to RVd, based on feedback from clinical experts. A threshold analysis was also conducted to estimate the OS HR needed for D-VMP to be cost-effective at a threshold of Canadian dollars (CAD)100,000 compared with RVd. Quality-of-life estimates were obtained from data collected from transplant-ineligible patients in the MM-020 trial. Costs included drug acquisition and administration, supportive care and monitoring, adverse events, subsequent treatment, and end-of-life care. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Canadian public payer over a 30-year time horizon. Cost-effecti ven ess results were presented in terms of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Costs and outcomes were discounted at a rate of 1.5% per year. The robustness of the results and the impact of the model's assumptions were tested in sensitivity and scenario analyses. Results: In the reference case, RVd was associated with the highest total number of life years gained and QALYs. ICERs for RVd were CAD 43,632 per QALY gained versus Rd, CAD 70,488 per QALY gained versus VMP, and RVd was superior to D-VMP (more QALYs and lower costs). Scenario analyses showed that the most sensitive factors were the use of the second-best fitting model for extrapolating OS (RVd vs. VMP ICER increased by CAD 13,007) and the assumption of no drug wastage (RVd vs. Rd ICER decreased by CAD 7,236). Age of patients at baseline was associated with substantial variation in ICER across all comparators, with older patients having larger ICERs. For D-VMP to be cost effective over RVd at the threshold of CAD 100,000, the required HR for OS will have to be 0.18 or better versus VMP in the ALCYONE (NCT02195479) trial; for comparison, the current PFS and time to second progression (PFS2) HRs have been reported as 0.43 and 0.59 in the SALCYONE trial. Conclusions: This cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated that RVd is associated with both survival and QALY gains compared with treatments that are currently available or pending approval and is a cost-effective strategy in the management of patients with NDMM not intended for ASCT in Canada, a setting with a high unmet need in terms of patient surv val.

AB  - Background: DARA, a human anti-CD38 IgGκ monoclonal antibody, is approved in many countries as monotherapy in relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM), in combination with standard-of-care (SoC) regimens in RRMM and upfront in transplant ineligible NDMM. DARA is also under investigation as part of induction, consolidation, and maintenance treatment in patients with NDMM who are transplant eligible. However, no studies have specifically compared DARA maintenance to current SoC maintenance regimens. Although deep response as measured by MRD negativity has been associated with positive long-term clinical outcomes, and previous studies have demonstrated that DARA increases MRD negativity rates when combined with SoC therapy, MRD as a primary end point has not been examined in the context of frontline DARA treatment in NDMM. The ongoing phase 3 AURIGA (MMY3021) study will evaluate whether the addition of DARA to lenalidomide maintenance therapy increases the conversion rate to MRD negativity after 1 year of maintenance treatment, compared to lenalidomide alone, in patients with NDMM who are MRD positive after ASCT. Study Design and Methods: This ongoing multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 3 study will enroll approximately 214 patients from up to 60 sites in the United States. Patients 18-79 years of age are eligible if they have NDMM, have not been previously treated with an anti-CD38 antibody, have completed 4-8 total cycles of induction therapy (and/or consolidation therapy), have undergone ASCT, have achieved a very good partial response or better by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria after ASCT and/or consolidation therapy, are MRD-positive by next-generation flow (NGF) or next-generation sequencing (NGS), at 60-100 days post-ASCT (or ≤60 days post consolidation therapy). Patients will be stratified by cytogenetic risk status (high risk vs standard risk/unknown status) and randomized 1:1 to DARA plus lenalidomide versus lenalidomide alone. Patients in both arms will receive 10 mg lenalidomide orally continuously during each 28-day cycle. After Cycle 3, if lenalidomide is well tolerated, the dose may be increased to 15 mg at the discretion of the investigator. Patients in the DARA plus lenalidomide arm will receive DARA SC (1,800 mg DARA co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 [rHuPH20; 2,000 U/mL; ENHANZE® drug delivery technology, Halozyme, Inc.]) QW in Cycles 1-2, Q2W in Cycles 3-6, and Q4W thereafter. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal, or for a maximum of 36 cycles. The primary endpoint is the MRD-negativity conversion rate (assessed at a 10-5 sensitivity threshold) at 12 months of treatment, assessed via NGS. MRD will also be assessed at 6, 18, 24, and 36 months. Importantly, use of the novel primary endpoint of MRD-negativity will allow for earlier assessment of outcomes and evaluation of deeper response than traditional endpoints such as progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints include overall MRD-negativity rate at any time, duration of MRD negativity, rate of complete response or better (≥CR), duration of ≥CR, PFS, OS, health-related quality of life, and safety.

AB  - Introduction and Background: We compared the efficacy and safety of daratumumab (D) in combination with Rd vs. Rd alone in patients with RRMM in a randomised, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 study (POLLUX; NCT02076009). Patient/Material and Methods: Patients with ≥1 prior line of therapy were randomised (1:1) to R 25 mg orally on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle and d 40 mg weekly, with or without D (16 mg/kg qw for 8 weeks, q2w for 16 weeks, then q4w until progression). The primary endpoint is PFS. Results: 569 patients were randomised. Patients received a median of 1 prior line of therapy (range 1-11), 19 % received ≥3 prior lines of therapy. 86 % received prior PI, 55 % received prior IMiD (including 18 % prior R), and 44 % received both PI and IMiD; 27 % were refractory to last line of prior therapy, 18 % were PI refractory, and none were R refractory. After median follow-up of 13.5 months, D significantly improved median PFS (63 % reduction in the risk of progression/death) and TTP for DRd vs. Rd (Table 1). D significantly increased ORR (93 % vs. 76 %) and rates of VGPR or better (76 % vs. 44 %) and CR or better (43 % vs. 19 %) for DRd vs. Rd, respectively (all P<0.0001). The most common (>30 %) TEAEs (DRd/Rd) were neutropenia (59 %/43 %), diarrhoea (43 %/25 %), fatigue (35 %/28 %), upper respiratory tract infection (32 %/21 %), and anaemia (31 %/35 %). Most common grade 3/4 TEAEs (>10 %) were neutropenia (52 %/ 37 %), thrombocytopenia (13 %/14 %), and anaemia (12 %/20 %). The rate of grade 3/4 infections was 28 % and 23 %, respectively. Discontinuation rates due to TEAEs were similar (7 %/8 %). D-associated infusion-related reactions (IRR; 48 % of patients) mostly were grade 1/2 (grade 3/4, 5 %/0 %); most (92 % of IRRs) occurred during the first infusion. Conclusions: The combination of D and Rd potentially represents a new standard of care for patients with ≥1 prior treatment. (Table Presented).

AB  - Introduction: High-risk cytogenetic abnormalities and International Staging System (ISS) disease stage III confer poor outcomes in MM pts. In the phase 3 CASSIOPEIA study, at median follow-up of 18.8 mo, D-VTd significantly reduced the risk of progression/death by 53%, and improved rates of stringent complete response (sCR), CR or better (≥CR), and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity vs VTd in transplant-eligible NDMM pts. We present a subgroup analysis of high-risk pts in CASSIOPEIA based on cytogenetic risk and ISS stage. Methods: Transplant-eligible NDMM pts were stratified by site affiliation (IFM or HOVON), ISS stage (I, II, or III), and cytogenetic risk status. High-risk cytogenetic pts had del17p (≥50% abnormal cells) and/or t(4;14) (≥30% abnormal cells) by centrally assessed FISH. Pts were randomized 1:1 to 4 pre-transplant induction and 2 post-transplant consolidation cycles with D-VTd or VTd. Primary endpoint was sCR post-consolidation (Day 100 post-ASCT), per IMWG. Additional endpoints were MRD-negativity (multiparametric flow cytometry; 10ˆ–5) and ≥CR rates, and PFS. Results: Of 1,085 pts randomized to D-VTd (n=543) or VTd (n=542), 15.5% had a high-risk cytogenetic abnormality. ISS staging was 39.8%, 45.0%, and 15.2% for stage I, II, and III, with more pts classified as stage II in D-VTd vs VTd (47.0% vs 43.0%) and similar pts classified as stage III in D-VTd vs VTd (15.5% vs 14.9%). Post-consolidation sCR rates were significantly higher with D-VTd vs VTd (28.9% vs 20.3%; odds ratio [OR], 1.60; 95% CI, 1.21-2.12; P=0.0010). Prespecified subgroup analyses of sCR showed consistent treatment effect of D-VTd over VTd across subgroups except in high-risk cytogenetic (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.42-1.66) and ISS stage III (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.54-2.12) pts. However, ≥CR rates favored D-VTd vs VTd (high-risk cytogenetic, 36.6% vs 32.6%; OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.58-2.10 and ISS stage III, 44.0% vs 33.3%; OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.83-2.88). MRD-negative rate was higher for D-VTd vs VTd (63.7% vs 43.5%; OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.78-2.90; P <0.0001), including in high-risk cytogenetic (59.8% vs 44.2%; OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.02-3.46) and ISS stage III (64.3% vs 45.7%; OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.15-4.00) subgroups. At median follow-up of 18.8 mo, D-VTd reduced the risk of progression/death vs VTd (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.33-0.67; P<0.0001), including in high-risk cytogenetic (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.35-1.30) and ISS stage III (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.32-1.39) subgroups. Conclusions: Prespecified subgroup analyses of sCR demonstrated that the treatment benefit of D-VTd over VTd was consistent across subgroups except pts with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities and ISS stage III disease; however, strict IMWG criteria were used for sCR. Importantly, D-VTd resulted in a benefit in terms of ≥CR and MRD-negative rates, as well as PFS, in these high-risk pt subgroups. The clinical benefit of these deeper responses will be evaluated with additional follow-up and in Part 2 of the study.

AB  - Background: DARA, a human, CD38-targeting, IgGκ monoclonal antibody, is approved in many countries for use as monotherapy in relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM), and in combination with standard-of-care regimens in RRMM and transplant-ineligible NDMM. Given the initial safety and efficacy observed with DARA plus VRd (D-VRd) in the safety run-in cohort of the ongoing phase 2 GRIFFIN study in TE NDMM pts, the phase 3 PERSEUS study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of D-VRd versus VRd alone in TE NDMM. Methods: This is an ongoing multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 3 study of D-VRd versus VRd alone in TE NDMM pts. Approximately 690 pts across Europe will be stratified by ISS stage and cytogenetic risk (high risk defined as presence of del17p, t[4;14], or t[14;16]) and randomized in a 1:1 ratio. All pts will receive VRd (V: 1.3 mg/m2 SC Days 1, 4, 8, 11; R: 25 mg PO Days 1-21; d: 40 mg PO Days 1-4, 9-12) for 4 pre-transplant induction and 2 post-transplant consolidation cycles (all 28-d cycles), followed by R (10 mg PO Days 1-28) maintenance until progressive disease (PD). Pts in the DARA group will also receive subcutaneous DARA (1,800 mg co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 [rHuPH20; Halozyme]) QW in Cycles 1-2, Q2W in Cycles 3-6, and Q4W in maintenance Cycles 7+ until PD. After induction, pts will undergo melphalan 200 mg/m2 conditioning and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Pts in the DARA group who achieve sustained minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity (10-5 threshold; assessed by NGS) for 12 months after ≥24 months of maintenance will stop DARA but continue R maintenance until PD; upon loss of CR or MRD-negative status, pts will restart DARA treatment. All pts will receive preinfusion medications. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include MRD-negative rate, overall response rate, PFS on next line of therapy, overall survival, time to and duration of response, health-related quality of life, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, stem cell yield after mobilization, time to engraftment post-ASCT, and safety.

AB  - Introduction : Daratumumab (D) is a human monoclonal antibody targeting CD38 that is approved as a monotherapy and in combination with standard of care regimens for patients (pts) with RRMM. Here, we provide an update of CASTOR (NCT02136134), a randomized, multicenter, phase 3 study of DVd vs Vd in pts with RRMM. Methods : Eligible pts received ≥1 prior line of therapy and were randomly assigned to receive 8 cycles (every 3 weeks) of Vd (V 1.3 mg/m2 subcutaneously on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11; d 20 mg orally or intravenously [IV] on Days 1-2, 4-5, 8-9, and 11-12) with or without D (16 mg/kg IV once weekly in Cycles 1-3, every 3 weeks for Cycles 4-8, and every 4 weeks thereafter until progressive disease [PD]). Pts who progressed on the Vd arm were allowed to cross over and receive D monotherapy. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Minimal residual disease (MRD) via next generation sequencing was assessed upon suspected complete response (CR) and at 6 and 12 months after the first dose at 3 sensitivity thresholds (10 , 10 , and 10 ) using the clonoSEQ assay (V.1.3; Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA). Cytogenetic risk was determined by next generation sequencing: high-risk pts had t(4;14), t(14;16), and/or del17p abnormalities, and standard-risk pts were confirmed negative for these abnormalities. PFS on subsequent line of therapy (PFS2; defined as time from randomization to PD after next line of subsequent therapy or death) was also examined. Results : 251 pts received DVd and 247 pts received Vd. The median (range) age was 64.0 (30-88) years. Pts received a median of 2 (1-10) prior therapies; 61% received prior autologous stem cell transplant, 66% received prior bortezomib, 42% received prior lenalidomide, 48% received prior proteasome inhibitor plus immunomodulatory drug, and 28% were refractory to lenalidomide. Median duration of single-agent D in DVd arm after 8 cycles of Vd was 11.9 months. After median follow-up of 19.4 months, PFS was significantly prolonged and the 18-month PFS rate was higher with DVd vs Vd (Table). Significant PFS benefit was observed with DVd regardless of the number of prior lines of therapy received, but the benefit was most pronounced in patients receiving 1 prior line of therapy (Table). The overall response rate and rates of ≥very good partial response (VGPR) and ≥CR were significantly higher with DVd vs Vd (Table). MRD-negative rates were >3 times higher with DVd vs Vd in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (19% vs 4% at 10 , P <0.0001; 12% vs 2% at 10 , P <0.0001; 5% vs 1% at 10 , P <0.005) and in pts that received 1 prior line of therapy (24% vs 4% at 10 , P <0.0001; 14% vs 3% at 10 , P <0.005; 7% vs 2% at 10 , P=0.060). At the 10 sensitivity threshold, MRD-negativity was associated with prolonged PFS. PFS2 was significantly improved with DVd vs Vd in the ITT population (hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.78; P=0.0005; Figure 1). No PFS2 events occurred in MRD-negative pts (at 10 ) treated with DVd (Figure 2). PFS2 was also prolonged in pts who received 1 prior line of therapy (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.21-0.69; P=0.0009; Figure 1) and in pts with ≥VGPR (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.17-0.70; P=0.002). Among high cytogenetic risk pts (DVd, n=44; Vd, n=51), median PFS2 was not reached (NR) in DVd vs 15.9 months in Vd (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.24-1.05; P=0.0647). Time to next therapy (TTNT) was significantly longer with DVd vs Vd (median NR vs 9.7 months; HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.23-0.39; P <0.0001), and in pts who received 1 prior line of therapy (median NR vs 11.1 months; HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.15-0.36; P <0.0001). TTNT was also significantly prolonged in high cytogenetic risk pts (median 21.2 vs 9.8 months; HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.21-0.71; P=0.0015). The most common (>10%) grade 3/4 TEAEs were thrombocytopenia (46% vs 33%), anemia (15% vs 16%), and neutropenia (14% vs 5%). A total of 10% of DVd and 9% of Vd pts discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. No new safety signals were reported. Updated efficacy and safety data will be presented. Conclusions : DVd con inues to significantly prolong PFS and induce deep and durable responses. DVd improved efficacy regardless of prior lines of therapy, with pts who received only 1 prior line of therapy benefitting the most. Durable responses with 11.9 months of single-agent D in the DVd arm translated into longer PFS2 and TTNT. The safety profile of DVd remains consistent with earlier reports after longer follow-up.

AB  - Introduction: Management of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM), which accounts for 1% of all cancers, is an area in dire need of therapeutic innovation. In recent years, the introduction of novel agents is one of the major advances in the management of patients with NDMM, in both transplant- eligible and transplant- ineligible candidates. Studies have combined daratumumab, a human IgGκ monoclonal antibody that targets CD38 which is highly expressed on myeloma cells, with proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents-based regimens in the first-line treatment of NDMM. The purpose of our study is to explore and consolidate the efficacy of upfront daratumumab combination regimen in patients with NDMM. Methods: We systematically conducted a comprehensive literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE databases and meeting abstracts from inception through June 2019. Phase III RCTs utilizing daratumumab in patients with newly diagnosed/ untreated multiple myeloma were incorporated in the analysis. A generic inverse variance method was used to calculate the estimated pooled hazard ratio (HR) for progression-free survival (PFS) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Mantel-Haenszel (MH) method was used to calculate the estimated pooled risk ratio (RR) for overall response rate (ORR), including stringent complete response (sCR), CR and very good partial response (VGPR). Heterogeneity was assessed with Cochran's Q -statistic. Random effects model was applied. Results: Three phase III RCTs with a total of 2,528 patients with NDMMwere included.Studies compared daratumumab (D) + bortezomib (V) + melphan (M) + prednisone (P) vs VMP, D + lenalidomide (R) + dexamethasone (d) vs Rd, and DVd + thalidomide (T) vs VTd. The randomization ratio was 1:1 in all studies. The I2statistic for heterogeneity was 0, suggesting homogeneity among RCT. The pooled HR for PFS was statistically significant at 0.52 (95% CI: 0.44-0.61; P < 0.0001). The PFS benefit was observed in all ISS categories, types of immunoglobulin (Ig) and standard risk cytogenetic; ISS I cohort (HR, 0.55; 95% CI: 0.37- 0.82; P = 0.003), ISS II cohort (HR, 0.43; 95% CI: 0.33- 0.55; P < 0.0001), ISS III cohort (HR, 0.63; 95% CI: 0.48- 0.82; P = 0.0006), IgG cohort (HR, 0.56; 95% CI: 0.40- 0.77; P = 0.0003), non-IgG cohort (HR, 0.52; 95% CI: 0.28- 0.97; P = 0.04), and standard risk cytogenetic cohort (HR, 0.43; 95% CI: 0.35- 0.53; P < 0.0001). The pooled HR for PFS in high risk cytogenetic cohort was not statistically significant at 0.76 (95% CI: 0.53- 1.10; P = 0.15). The pooled RR for ORR was 1.13 (95% CI: 1.01-1.26; P = 0.03), sCR was 2.02 (95% CI: 1.33-3.08; P = 0.001), CR was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.20-1.79; P = 0.0002),and VGPR was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.82-1.25; P = 0.93). The pooled RR for negative minimal residual disease (MRD) was 2.54 (95% CI: 1.24-5.20; P = 0.01). Conclusions: Upfront combination regimen with daratumumab significantly improved PFS, ORR, sCR and CR along with negative MRD, compared to control arm in patients with NDMM. The improvement in PFS was noted across all subgroups except in high-risk cytogenetic group. More randomized studies are required to explore further novel agents and to formulate optimal combination regimen to improve survival in this high-risk cytogenetic subset.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Introduction: Daratumumab is a human monoclonal antibody targeting CD38 that demonstrated superior efficacy in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd) versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (Rd) in a pre-specified interim analysis of a randomized phase 3 study of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM; Dimopoulos MA, et al. N Engl J Med 2016; in press). We report subgroup analyses from this study in patients (pts) who received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy (1-3 PL), including outcomes based on high-risk cytogenetics within these subgroups. Methods: Patients (pts) who received ≥1 prior line of therapy were randomized (1:1) to Rd (lenalidomide: 25 mg PO on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle; dexamethasone: 40 mg PO weekly) with or without daratumumab (16 mg/kg IV qw for 8 weeks, q2w for 16 weeks, then q4w until progression). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The site investigator determined the number of prior lines of therapy according to IMWG consensus guidelines. Treatment-free interval (TFI) was defined as the duration between the end/start date of last line of prior therapy and the date of randomization. Pts with high-risk cytogenetic status had at least one of the following abnormalities as assessed via fluorescence in-situ hybridization or karyotyping by local laboratory assessment: t(4;14), t(14;16), or del17p. Results: In the 1-3 PL subgroup (DRd, n=272; Rd, n=264), PFS was significantly improved with DRd vs Rd (median: not reached [NR] vs 18.4 months; HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.25-0.50; P<0.0001), with estimated 12-month PFS rates of 83.2% vs 60.4%, respectively. Time to progression was also significantly longer with DRd vs Rd (median: NR vs 18.4 months; HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.22-0.46; P<0.0001). ORR (94% vs 77%), rates of very good partial response (VGPR) or better (76% vs 45%) and complete response (CR) or better (44% vs 20%) were significantly higher with DRd vs Rd, respectively (P<0.0001 for all). Among responders, median time to VGPR or better was 2.8 months in DRd vs 2.9 months in Rd; median time to CR or better was 6.7 months vs 7.5 months, respectively. For pts in the 1-3 PL subgroup with high-risk cytogenetics (n=33 in each treatment group), significantly longer PFS was observed in DRd vs Rd (median: NR vs 8.3 months; HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14-0.67; P=0.0019). Significantly higher ORR (91% vs 69%; P=0.0267), rate of VGPR or better (73% vs 28%; P=0.0004), and rate of CR or better (36% vs 9%; P=0.0104) were achieved in pts with high-risk cytogenetic status treated with DRd vs Rd, respectively. For 1-3 PL pts who had a TFI of >12 months (DRd, n=138; Rd, n=145), median PFS was NR in DRd vs 18.4 months in Rd (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24-0.74; P=0.0019; Figure A); the estimated 12- month PFS rate was 88.0% vs 74.5%, respectively. ORR was significantly higher with DRd vs Rd (96% vs 86%, P=0.0084), along with rate of VGPR or better (77% vs 56%; P=0.0008) and rate of CR or better (43% vs 27%; P=0.0083). Among pts with a TFI of ≤12 months (DRd, n=134; Rd, n=119), median PFS was NR in DRd vs 10.3 months in Rd (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.21-0.51; P<0.0001; Figure B); the estimated 12-month PFS rate was 78.1% vs 43.1%, respectively. ORR (92% vs 67%), rate of VGPR or better (76% vs 32%), and rate of CR or better (44% vs 10%) were all significantly higher with DRd vs Rd (P<0.0001 for all). Among pts with 1-3 PL who were refractory to their last line of therapy (DRd, n=73; Rd, n=67), PFS was significantly prolonged with DRd vs Rd (median: NR vs 10.3 mo; HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25- 0.72; P=0.0010). ORR (92% vs 66%; P=0.0002), rate of VGPR or better (72% vs 34%; P<0.0001), and rate of CR or better (47% vs 14%; P<0.0001) were significantly higher with DRd vs Rd. Data for all subgroup analyses will be updated for the meeting. Conclusions: Responses with DRd were deep and durable which translated into significantly improved clinical outcomes vs Rd in 1-3 PL pts with RRMM. The results of these subgroup analyses suggest that the treatment benefit of DRd vs Rd was maintained across these subgroups, in luding pts with TFI of ≤12 months and those who were refractory to their last line of therapy.

AB  - Background: D-Rd significantly reduced the risk of progression/death by 44% in transplant-ineligible NDMM pts vs Rd in the phase 3 MAIA study. To examine the impact of age on efficacy/safety of D-Rd vs Rd in this population, a subgroup analysis was conducted in pts <75 and ≥75 y of age. Methods:Transplant-ineligible NDMM pts were randomized 1:1 to Rd ± DARA; stratification was based on age (<75 vs ≥75 y), ISS (I, II, III), and region (North America vs Other). Pts received 28-day cycles of either R 25 or 10 mg (based on renal function) PO QD on Days 1-21 and either d 40 or 20 mg (based on age or BMI) PO/IV weekly until progression. In the D-Rd arm, pts received daratumumab 16 mg/kg IV QW for Cycles 1-2, Q2W for Cycles 3-6, and Q4W thereafter until progression. PFS is the primary endpoint. Results: Among 737 randomized pts (D-Rd, n=368; Rd, n=369), 321 (44%) were ≥75 y of age. For D-Rd vs Rd, relative median dose intensity for R was 79% vs 93% for <75 y subgroup and 66% vs 89% for ≥75 y subgroup, respectively. After median follow-up of 28 mo, significant PFS benefit of D-Rd vs Rd was maintained in both <75 and ≥75 y subgroups (Table). Deeper responses and MRD-negative rate (10-5 threshold) remained higher with D-Rd vs Rd in both subgroups (Table). Most common (≥10%; D-Rd/Rd) grade 3/4 TEAEs in ≥75 y pts were neutropenia (60%/41%), lymphopenia (19%/12%), anemia (16%/22%), pneumonia (15%/10%), leukopenia (12%/6%), and thrombocytopenia (8%/11%). Fewer pts receiving D-Rd vs Rd discontinued treatment due to TEAEs (<75 y: 5% vs 12%; ≥75 y: 10% vs 21%). Conclusions: D-Rd pts received less R vs Rd group regardless of age. Efficacy of D-Rd in <75 and ≥75 y pts was consistent with the ITT population, and D-Rd demonstrated acceptable tolerability regardless of age. Together with the phase 3 ALCYONE study, these studies confirm clinical benefit of daratumumab plus standard-of-care in transplant-ineligible NDMM pts ≥75 y of age.

AB  - Introduction: The use of lenalidomide (LEN) and bortezomib (BTZ) in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients (pts), along with continuous or maintenance therapy paradigm have improved survival outcomes. However, many pts progress while on these agents or discontinue them due to toxicity. There is a need for novel, efficacious, and tolerable regimens that can treat MM pts who are exposed or refractory to LEN or BTZ. The proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib and the anti- CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab have both been approved as single agents or as components of combination regimens for the treatment of RRMM. The combination of carfilzomib, dexamethasone, and daratumumab has been shown to be efficacious and safe in RRMM in the phase 1 study MMY1001 (Chari, Blood 2019). We present results from the primary analysis of CANDOR, a multicenter, phase 3, randomized study comparing carfilzomib, dexamethasone, and daratumumab (KdD) vs carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) in RRMM pts. Methods: RRMM pts with measurable disease who had received 1-3 prior lines of therapy, with partial response or better to ≥1 line of therapy were eligible. Pts were randomized 2:1 to KdD or Kd. All pts received carfilzomib (K) as a 30-min intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of each 28- day cycle (20 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 during cycle 1 and 56 mg/m2 thereafter). Daratumumab (8 mg/kg) was administered IV on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1 and at 16 mg/kg once weekly for the remaining doses of the first 2 cycles, then every 2 wks for 4 cycles (cycles 3 to 6), and every 4 wks thereafter. All pts received 40 mg dexamethasone oral or IV weekly (20 mg for pts >75 years). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), minimal residual disease (MRD) negative-complete response at 12 months (threshold, 10- 5 cells), overall survival (OS), time to response, and safety. Results: 466 pts (KdD: 312; Kd: 154) from 102 sites worldwide were randomized. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two arms. Median age was 64 years. Of the randomized pts, 42.3% and 90.3% received previous LEN- and BTZ-containing regimens, respectively. 33% of pts were LEN-refractory. The primary endpoint of PFS was met after a median follow-up of 16.9 mo and 16.3 mo for the KdD and Kd arms, respectively. Median PFS was not reached for the KdD arm vs 15.8 mo for the Kd arm (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.85; P=0.0014; Figure). PFS HRs favored KdD vs Kd across prespecified subgroups. Importantly, median PFS (KdD vs Kd) was not reached vs 12.1 mo in the LEN-exposed group (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34-0.80), and was not reached vs 11.1 mo in the LENrefractory group (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.28-0.74). Median time to first response was 1 mo in the KdD and Kd arms. ORR was 84.3% vs 74.7% (P=0.0040), and the rate of complete response or better was 28.5% vs 10.4%. MRD-negative complete response rate at 12 mo was 12.5% for KdD vs 1.3% for Kd (P<0.0001). Median OS was not reached in either arm at a median follow-up time of 17 mo (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.49-1.13; P=0.08). Median treatment duration was longer in the KdD than Kd arm (70.1 vs 40.3 wks). The incidence of grade ≥3 AEs was 82.1% and 73.9% in the KdD and Kd arms, respectively. Serious AEs occurred in 56.2% (KdD) and 45.8% (Kd). The rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs was similar in both arms (KdD, 22.4%; Kd, 24.8%). The frequency of grade ≥3 cardiac failure was 3.9% (KdD) and 8.5% (Kd); rate of cardiac failure event leading to K discontinuation was similar in the arms (3.9% and 4.6%). 5 deaths were reported as treatment-related, all in the KdD arm (pneumonia, sepsis, septic shock, acinetobacter infection, and cardio-respiratory arrest [n=1 each]). Additional efficacy endpoints, including key subgroup analyses will be presented. Conclusion: KdD resulted in a significant PFS benefit over Kd, with a 37% reduction in the risk of progression or death. Pts treated with KdD achieved deeper responses, with a nearly 10-times higher MRD negative-complete response rate vs Kd-treated pts. The PFS benefit of KdD was maintained across prespecified clinically important subgroups, particularly among LEN-exposed and LENrefractory pts. AEs were generally manageable and the incidence of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation was similar in the arms. Overall, KdD was associated with a favorable benefit-risk profile and represents an efficacious new regimen for RRMM, including for LEN-exposed and/or LEN-refractory pts. (Figure Presented) .

AB  - Objectives: CASTOR is an international randomised controlled trial comparing daratumumab in combination with bortezomib (Velcade®) and dexamethasone (DVd) versus bortezomib plus dexamethasone (Vd) among patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least one prior line of therapy. Consequential to the trial’s international design, many patients, particularly in the Vd arm, received subsequent therapy with regimens not available in the UK upon progression. The standard OS analysis generates bias and would underestimate the true OS benefit of DVd in UK. The aim of this analysis is to adjust for this bias and to provide OS estimates generalisable to the UK setting in 2L patients. Methods: A variety of methods were considered, however, due to data complexity and the array of treatment switches only the inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW) method was viable. Patients receiving a treatment that is not available in the UK were artificially censored at time of initiation. Time-dependant stabilized weights were calculated using repeated logistic regression models, including baseline and time varying covariates with stepwise selection used to determine regression models that best fit the data. Adjusted HRs for OS were calculated using a cox proportional hazards model including baseline characteristics and time-dependant weights. As the availability of subsequent treatment differs between Scotland and England, analyses were conducted separately by country. This methodology followed the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Decision Support Unit (DSU) technical support document. Results: Prior to adjustment, the OS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.51 (0.31; 0.84), p=0.0084 (unstratified analysis) in 2L patients. IPCW-adjusted HRs were 0.40 (0.22; 0.73, p=0.0025) and 0.44 (0.24; 0.79, p=0.0066) for England and Scotland, respectively. Conclusions: A higher OS benefit of DVd versus Vd is seen following adjustment for bias introduced by subsequent treatment not available in the UK setting.

AB  - Background: Addition of Dara to Vd and Rd improved complete (CR) and overall response rates (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) in relapsed MM. RVd followed by HDT, ASCT, and consolidation RVd achieves high response rates in previously untreated MM. The primary objective of this study is to determine if the addition of Dara to RVd will increase the stringent CR (sCR) rate by the end of post-ASCT consolidation therapy. Methods: This is an ongoing multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study conducted in the US. Key eligibility criteria include age 18- 70 years; eligibility for HDT and ASCT; documented MM per IMWG 2015 criteria; ECOG performance score of 0-2; and no prior systemic therapy for MM. An initial safety run-in phase was performed in 16 pts treated with Dara-RVd in order to assess potential dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during Cycle 1. Following successful completion of the safety run-in phase, approximately 200 pts will be randomized 1:1 to Dara-RVd or RVd. Pts receive 4 induction cycles (every 21 days) of RVd +/- Dara; followed by stem cell mobilization, HDT, ASCT; 2 consolidation cycles (every 21 days) of RVd +/- Dara; and maintenance therapy with R +/- Dara for 24 months. During induction and consolidation (cycles 1-6), all pts receive R 25 mg orally on Days 1-14; V 1.3 mg/m2 subcutaneously on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11; and d 40 mg weekly. In the Dara-RVd group, Dara 16 mg/kg IV is given on Days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-4 and on Day 1 of cycles 5-6. During maintenance (cycles 7-32), all pts receive R 10 mg daily (15 mg beginning at Cycle 10 if no tolerability issues) on Days 1-21 every 28 days; Dara 16 mg/kg IV is given every 56 days (every other cycle) in the Dara-RVd arm only. Here, we present the results of the pre-planned safety analysis after the first 4 cycles of therapy in the safety run-in phase of the study. Results: Sixteen pts were enrolled in the safety run-in, and all pts had completed at least 4 cycles of Dara-RVd as of 05 July 2017. Median age was 62.5 (range 46 to 65) years, and 50% were male. Thirteen percent of pts were ISS stage II and stage III, each. Most pts (63%) were ECOG 1. During Cycle 1, 3 pts experienced AEs that met Sponsor pre-defined DLT criteria: grade 3 fatigue on Day 15, gastroenteritis on Day 21, pneumonitis (due to infection) and hypotension on Day 5. None of these events were determined by the investigator to require treatment discontinuation, and all 3 pts remained on therapy. All 16 pts experienced at least 1 treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) during cycles 1-4; 3 (19%) pts had at least 1 serious AE (SAE), with 2 (13%) related to Dara (gastroenteritis and pneumonitis). Eight (50%) pts had grade 3-4 TEAEs, with 6 (38%) related to Dara. The most commonly reported grade 3-4 TEAEs were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (19% each), lymphopenia and leukopenia (13% each). Six (38%) pts experienced infections, including 1 Grade 3 SAE of gastroenteritis. There were no events of febrile neutropenia. There was no fatal outcome and no pt discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. Dara infusion related reactions (all Grade ≤2) were reported in 31% of pts during Cycles 1-4. To date, 11 pts had undergone mobilization with a median stem cell yield of 6.0 x 109(range 3.5-10.6) CD34+ cells/kg. All 16 pts in the safety run-in phase continue study treatment. Updated data and follow-up on these 16 pts will be presented at ASH. Conclusion: No new safety signals were identified with the addition of Dara to RVd during the first 4 cycles of Dara-RVd in 16 pts with newly diagnosed MM. The overall safety profile was consistent with those previously reported for Dara and RVd. The first 4 cycles of safety run-in phase 2 6 are completed, and all 16 pts continue therapy. Enrollment to the main phase of the randomized study is ongoing.

AB  - Lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVd) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is standard frontline therapy for transplant-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). The addition of daratumumab (D) to RVd (D-RVd) in transplant-eligible NDMM patients was evaluated. Patients (N = 207) were randomized 1:1 to D-RVd or RVd induction (4 cycles), ASCT, D-RVd or RVd consolidation (2 cycles), and lenalidomide or lenalidomide plus D maintenance (26 cycles). The primary end point, stringent complete response (sCR) rate by the end of post-ASCT consolidation, favored D-RVd vs RVd (42.4% vs 32.0%; odds ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-2.82; 1-sided P = .068) and met the prespecified 1-sided α of 0.10. With longer follow-up (median, 22.1 months), responses deepened; sCR rates improved for D-RVd vs RVd (62.6% vs 45.4%; P = .0177), as did minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity (10-5 threshold) rates in the intent-to-treat population (51.0% vs 20.4%; P < .0001). Four patients (3.8%) in the D-RVd group and 7 patients (6.8%) in the RVd group progressed; respective 24-month progression-free survival rates were 95.8% and 89.8%. Grade 3/4 hematologic adverse events were more common with D-RVd. More infections occurred with D-RVd, but grade 3/4 infection rates were similar. Median CD34+ cell yield was 8.2 × 106/kg for D-RVd and 9.4 × 106/kg for RVd, although plerixafor use was more common with D-RVd. Median times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment were comparable. Daratumumab with RVd induction and consolidation improved depth of response in patients with transplant-eligible NDMM, with no new safety concerns. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as %23NCT02874742.

AB  - Introduction: DARA, a human IgGK monoclonal antibody targeting CD38, is approved as monotherapy and in combination with standard-of-care (SoC) regimens for multiple myeloma (MM). In randomized studies, DARA-based regimens significantly improved response rates, depth of S esponse including minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity, and progression-free survival (PFS) in NDMM and relapsed/refractory MM pts. RVd followed by high-dose therapy (HDT), autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), and consolidation is a SoC regimen for US pts with NDMM. This phase 2, randomized study (GRIFFIN; NCT02874742) evaluated DARA plus RVd (D-RVd) in ASCT-eligible NDMM pts. A 16-pt safety run-in showed no safety concerns. Here, we present results that adding DARA to RVd improves responses rapidly, including depth of response, which increases with longer duration of therapy. Methods: Pts were randomized 1:1 to RVd ± DARA, stratified by ISS stage and creatinine clearance. Pts received 4 induction cycles, HDT, ASCT, 2 consolidation cycles, and maintenance with R ± DARA for 24 mo. During induction and consolidation (Cycles 1-6), pts received R 25 mg PO on Days 1-14; V 1.3 mg/m2 SC on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11; and d 40 mg QW every 21 days. DARA 16 mg/kg IV was given on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1-4 and Day 1 of Cycles 5-6. During maintenance (Cycles 7-32), pts received R 10 mg (15 mg in Cycles 10+ if tolerated) on Days 1-21 every 28 days ± DARA 16 mg/kg IV Q8W (or Q4W per pt decision after Amendment 2). The primary endpoint was the stringent complete response (sCR) rate by the end of consolidation per IMWG computer algorithm. The study had 80% power to detect a 15% improvement with a 1-sided alpha of 0.1 (equivalent to 2-sided alpha of 0.2). MRD (10-5 per IMWG criteria) was assessed by next-generation sequencing (clonoSEQ; Adaptive Biotechnologies). Results: A total of 207 pts (D-RVd n = 104; RVd n =103) were randomized. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced between arms. Median age was 60 yrs; 48% 37% and 14% of pts were ISS stage I, II, or III, respectively; 30 (15%) pts had high cytogenetic risk defined by FISH for del(17p), t(4;14), or t(14;16). The study met its primary endpoint; D-RVd improved the sCR rate by the end of consolidation (42.4% vs 32.0%; odds ratio 1.57; 95% CI, 0.87-2.82; 2-sided P = 0.1359); at the pre-set 2-sided alpha of 0.2. This improvement was observed in all pt subgroups except for the small subsets of ISS stage III or high-cytogenetic risk pts. Responses deepened over time (Figure); the sCR rate was 12% vs 7% with D-RVd vs RVd at the end of induction, increasing to 21% vs 14% after ASCT, and 50% vs 37% at the clinical cutoff (CCO; 13.5 mo median follow-up). D-RVd achieved higher overall response (99% vs 92%), >VGPR (91% vs 73%), and >CR (52% vs 42%) rates vs RVd by the end of consolidation. At the end of induction, 8/19 (42%) pts achieving >CR with D-RVd were MRD negative, compared to 1/13 (8%) pts achieving >CR with RVd. At the end of consolidation, 30/51 (59%) pts achieving >CR with D-RVd were MRD negative vs 10/41 (24%) pts achieving >CR with RVd. Due to the short median follow-up at CCO, PFS and OS were immature, S with 6 PFS events in each arm. Median stem cell yield was 8.1 vs 9.4 × 106 cells/kg for D-RVd vs RVd. Median (range) time to platelet engraftment was 13 (2-31) and 12 (1-23) days for D-RVd vs RVd; median (range) time to neutrophil engraftment was 12 (3-31) and 12 (2-23) days for D-RVd vs RVd. Grade 3/4 TEAEs (>10%) with D-RVd vs RVd included neutropenia (32% vs 15%), lymphopenia (23% vs 23%), thrombocytopenia (16% vs 8%), and leukopenia (15% vs 7%). There was no difference in the rate of grade 3/4 infections between arms. IRRs occurred in 41% of DARA-treated pts, which were primarily grade 1-2. Updated data will be presented. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that adding DARA to RVd significantly improves response rates and depth of response, including sCR and MRD negativity. As seen in other randomized studies, continued use of daratumumab improved depth of respons . The overall safety profile of D-RVd is consistent with previous reports with DARA plus SoC. Likewise, similar to what was reported from CASSIOPEIA, stem cell mobilization and ASCT are feasible with D-RVd, without a significant effect on hematopoietic reconstitution. The study is ongoing, with pts continuing maintenance therapy.

AB  - Background: Daratumumab is a human monoclonal antibody targeting CD38 that induces deep and durable responses with significant clinical benefit and is well tolerated as monotherapy and in combination with established standard- of-care regimens in patients with RRMM. Aims: To provide updated efficacy and safety data from CASTOR, a multicenter, phase 3, randomized, active-controlled study of DVd vs Vd in RRMM. Methods: Eligible patients with ≥1 prior line of therapy were randomly assigned to 8 cycles (every 3 weeks) of Vd (1.3mg/m2 SC bortezomib on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11; 20mg PO/IV dexamethasone on Days 1-2, 4-5, 8-9, and 11-12) with or without daratumumab (16mg/kg IV once weekly in Cycles 1-3, every 3 weeks for Cycles 4-8, then every 4 weeks until progression). Patients who were refractory to bortezomib were excluded. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed at suspected complete response (CR) and at 6 and 12 months after first dose at 3 sensitivity thresholds (10-4, 10-5, and 10-6) using the ClonoSEQ™ next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based assay (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA). Results: A total of 498 patients were randomized with median (range) age of 64 (30-88) years. Patients received a median (range) of 2 (1-10) prior lines of therapy; 66% of patients previously received bortezomib, and 21% were refractory to lenalidomide in their last prior line of therapy. After median follow-up of 13.0 months, DVd significantly prolonged PFS compared with Vd alone (median: not reached vs 7.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26-0.43; P<0.0001). Twelve-month PFS rates were 60% versus 22%, respectively. Significant PFS benefit was observed with DVd over Vd regardless of the number of prior lines of therapy, although the greatest benefit was seen in patients with 1 prior line of therapy (median: not reached vs 7.9 months; HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.14-0.34; P<0.0001). Overall response rate (ORR; 84%vs 63%) and rates of very good partial response (VGPR) or better (62%vs 29%) and CR or better (26% vs 10%) continued to be significantly higher with DVd compared with Vd (P<0.0001 for all). MRD-negative rates were more than 4 times higher at all 3 sensitivity thresholds with DVd versus Vd: 18.3% versus 3.6% at 10- 4(P<0.0001), 10.4% versus 2.4% at 10-5 (P<0.01), and 4.4% versus 0.8% at 10-6 (P<0.01). MRD-negative patients had prolonged PFS compared with MRDpositive patients at 10-5sensitivity threshold (Figure). At the clinical cut-off date, 37 (15%) deaths in the DVd group and 58 (24%) in the Vd group have been observed (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42-0.96), and follow up is ongoing. Thrombocytopenia was the most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse event (45% with DVd vs 33% with Vd). No new safety signals were reported after median treatment duration of 11 months with daratumumab. Updated efficacy and safety data with longer follow up will be presented at the meeting. (Figure Presented) Summary/Conclusions: DVd is superior to Vd in terms of PFS, ORR, depth of response, and MRD-negative rates, with no new safety signals reported. These updated data further support the use of DVd as a standard of care in RRMM, with the greatest benefit observed in patients with 1 prior line of therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carfilzomib and daratumumab are licensed in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), but no head-to-head trials have been conducted. METHODS: We used data from dossiers prepared for the German Federal Joint Committee based on two phase III randomized trials of carfilzomib-based therapies (ASPIRE, ENDEAVOR) and two of daratumumab-based therapies (POLLUX, CASTOR) to conduct a descriptive assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). HRQoL was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item HRQoL Questionnaire, with hazard ratios calculated for carfilzomib- and daratumumab-based therapy versus comparators for time to HRQoL deterioration of ≥ 10 points. Analyses were also conducted on data from the EORTC 20-item myeloma-specific questionnaire, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity scale, and the visual analog scale of the EuroQoL 5-dimension, 5-level questionnaire, where results for these instruments were available. As the designs and patient population of the four trials were similar but not identical, the analysis included only indirect, descriptive comparisons. RESULTS: Compared with lenalidomide/dexamethasone, median time to deterioration in global health status/QoL was longer for carfilzomib-based therapy versus control, but similar for daratumumab-based therapy and control. Compared with bortezomib/dexamethasone, time to deterioration was significantly longer for carfilzomib-based therapy versus control for global health status/QoL and numerous functional and symptom subscales. HRQoL measurement is feasible in large RRMM populations. CONCLUSION: Descriptive assessment of HRQoL data suggests potential benefits for carfilzomib-based over daratumumab-based therapy.

AB  - Background: In patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma, carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd56) was superior to bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd) in the randomized, phase 3 ENDEAVOR trial for progression- free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44-0.65; P<0.0001). In ENDEAVOR, both Kd56 and Vd were planned to be administered until disease progression, while in other clinical trials, e.g., the randomized, phase 3 CASTOR trial comparing Vd with or without daratumumab, Vd was administered for up to 8 cycles (6 months) according to its EU label. Aims: To estimate how efficacy and safety results for Kd56 vs Vd would have differed if Vd had been given for up to 8 cycles only. Methods: For the efficacy analysis, published PFS data from the ENDEAVOR (Dimopoulos et al., Lancet Oncol 2017) and CASTOR (Spencer et al., ASH 2017) trials were used in three steps. First, ENDEAVOR Vd patients were matched to average characteristics of CASTOR Vd patients using matching-adjusted indirect comparison methodology. Then, a piecewise Cox regression model was fitted to the matched ENDEAVOR Vd data and re-constructed virtual patient-level CASTOR Vd data that allowed assessing the increased PFS risk due to stopping Vd treatment after 8 cycles vs continuing Vd treatment beyond 8 cycles till progression. Finally, the PFS HR for Kd56 vs Vd from ENDEAVOR was adjusted according to the increased PFS risk for the period beyond 8 cycles. The presented modeling approach has been previously accepted by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK (Technology Appraisal Guidance TA457, 2017). For the safety analyses, using most recent data on file, only adverse events (AEs) that occurred during the first 8 cycles plus 30 days of follow-up after the last dose were considered for patients in the Vd arm of the ENDEAVOR trial. Besides the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of grade 3 or more (Gr3+) for Vd 8 cycles, Kd56/Vd 8 cycles exposureadjusted risk ratios were estimated for Gr3+ TEAEs. Results: During the first 8 cycles, the risk reduction in PFS for Kd56 vs Vd 8 cycles was equal to that estimated for Kd56 vs Vd in ENDEAVOR. For Vd patients, the increase in PFS risk associated with stopping Vd beyond 8 cycles was estimated to be 32% (HR: 1.32, 95% CI 0.89-1.96, P=0.17). This corresponds to a 60% risk reduction in PFS for Kd56 vs Vd (HR: 0.40; 95% CI 0.26-0.63; P<0.0001) beyond 8 cycles (Figure). The frequency of Gr3+ TEAEs was 81.9% for Kd56, 71.1% for Vd, and was estimated to be 64.5% for Vd 8 cycles. Incidence of Gr3+ peripheral neuropathy was 2.4%, 9.6%, and 8.6% for Kd56, Vd, and Vd 8 cycles, respectively. The exposure- adjusted risk ratios of Kd56 vs Vd 8 cycles were estimated to be 0.61 (95% CI 0.53-0.71) for all Gr3+ TEAEs and 0.08 (95% CI 0.04-0.17) for Gr3+ peripheral neuropathy. Summary/Conclusion: Results from the matched-efficacy analysis indicated that the duration of Vd treatment has a significant impact. If Vd had been given for 8 cycles, the relative decrease in PFS risk with Kd56 would have been larger than that observed in ENDEAVOR where Vd treatment was continued beyond 8 cycles till progression. The approach used in this study adjusts for differences in trial design such as Vd treatment duration, allows to reduce bias, and is a robust methodology. In contrast, indirect treatment comparisons including network meta-analyses that do not adjust for differences in trial design and/or patient populations are susceptible to greater bias.

We report a pre-specified interim analysis of the first randomised, controlled study of D (CASTOR; NCT02136134). Methods: Pts with ≥1 prior line of therapy were randomised (1:1) to 8 cycles q3w of bortezomib (V)/dexamethasone (d) (V: 1.3 mg/m2 sc on Days 1, 4, 8, 11; d: 20 mg po on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12) ± D (16 mg/kg iv qw in Cycles 1-3, Day 1 of Cycles 4-8, then q4w until progression). Primary endpoint was PFS. Results: 498 pts (DVd, 251; Vd, 247) were randomised. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced. Pts received a median of 2 prior lines of therapy (range 1-10). 76% received prior IMiD; 66% received prior V; 48% received prior PI and IMiD; 33% were IMiD-refractory; 32% were refractory to last line of prior therapy. With a median follow-up of 7.4 months, D significantly improved PFS (61% reduction in risk of progression), ORR, rates of ≥VGPR, rates of ≥CR, and delayed time to next therapy (Table). Median OS was NR in both groups. Most common (>25%) AEs (DVd/Vd) were thrombocytopenia (59%/44%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (47%/ 38%), diarrhea (32%/22%) and anemia (26%/31%). Most common grade 3/4 AEs (>10%) were thrombocytopenia (45%/33%), anaemia (14%/16%), neutropenia (13%/4%). 7%/9% of pts discontinued due to a TEAE. D-associated infusion-related reactions (45% of pts) mostly occurred during the first infusion; most were grade 1/2 (grade 3/4, 9%/0%). Additional subgroup analyses will be presented. Conclusions: D in combination with Vd significantly improved PFS and ORR and delayed time to next therapy vs Vd alone. DVd doubled both VGPR and sCR/CR rates vs Vd alone. Safety of DVd is consistent with the known safety profile of D and Vd. The addition of D to Vd should be considered a new standard of care for RRMM pts currently receiving Vd alone.

AB  - Background: The CANDOR trial showed that carfilzomib, dexamethasone, and daratumumab (KdD) improved progression-free survival (PFS) vs carfilzomib, dexamethasone (Kd) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.85) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) (Usmani et al, Blood 2019;134:LBA-6). Aims: To present the results of subgroup analyses in CANDOR by number of prior lines of therapy and prior therapies. Methods: RRMM patients (1-3 prior lines of therapy) were randomized 2:1 to KdD or Kd. The primary endpoint was PFS; secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete response (CR) at 12 months (threshold, 10-5), and safety. Patients were evaluated by number of prior lines of therapy, and by prior lenalidomide (LEN) or bortezomib (BOR) therapy. Results: Of 466 patients randomized, 43% had 1 prior lines of therapy, 57% had ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy, 42% were LEN-exposed, 33% were LEN-refractory, 91% were BOR-exposed, and 33% were BOR-refractory. Treatment effects were generally consistent with KdD vs Kd across subgroups for PFS, ORR, and MRD-negative CR rates (table). The rate of grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events in the subgroups by prior lines of therapy was similar to that in the broader CANDOR population. A comprehensive analysis of these subgroups, including patient characteristics and safety profiles, will be presented at the meeting. Summary/Conclusion: Safety and efficacy results were generally consistent across subgroups, irrespective of lenalidomide or bortezomib refractory status, or number of prior lines of therapy.

AB  - Background: In the phase 3 CANDOR study (N = 466) of patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (HR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.85; p = 0.0014) was observed in the carfilzomib, dexamethasone, daratumumab (KdD) arm vs carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) arm. Aims: To report a secondary endpoint of CANDOR evaluating health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods: HRQoL was assessed using the Global Health status (GHS)/ Quality of Life (QoL) domain of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30), which was completed on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and every 28±7 days through the first follow-up visit. The GHS/QoL was scored from 0-100, with higher scores indicating better QoL. The scores were compared between the KdD and Kd arms using a restricted maximum likelihood-based mixed effects model for repeated measures under the assumption of missing data at random. A minimally important difference of 5 points between arms was prespecified. An exploratory time-by-time sensitivity analysis by ANCOVA was used to evaluate the treatment effect on the GHS/QoL score among pts who remained on treatment until the specified visit (cycle 3 and every 3 cycles thereafter). Results: GHS/QoL completion rates from baseline through up to cycle 26 (study ongoing) for randomized pts who remained on treatment were > 81% for both the KdD and Kd arms; the median extent of missing GHS/QoL data was 5.3% for the KdD arm and 12.1% for the Kd arm. KdD was associated with higher GHS/QoL scores relative to Kd starting at Cycle 7 and this was maintained until Cycle 26 (by mixed effect model, overall LSME difference [95% CI], 0.06 [-2.39, 2.50]; p = 0.96). At Cycle 18, the mean difference between arms approached the prespecified clinically meaningful difference of 5 points by ANCOVA (difference: KdD-Kd [SE], 4.06 [2.45]). In an exploratory analysis of pts who remained on treatment at each cycle, a higher rate of pts reported an improvement of ≥10 points in GHS/QoL score from baseline in the KdD vs Kd arms, with the greatest differences observed at Cycle 7 (Odds Ratio [OR] for KdD/Kd [95% CI], 2.37 [1.29, 4.34]), Cycle 9 (OR [95% CI], 2.96 [1.46-6.03]), Cycle 13 (OR [95% CI], 2.44 (1.15-5.17), and Cycle 16 (OR [95% CI], 2.77 [1.27-6.07]). Summary/Conclusion: In addition to the superior clinical benefit observed with KdD vs Kd, HRQoL was maintained with the KdD triplet. A higher rate of pts treated with KdD reported an improvement of ≥10 points from baseline.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma (MM) patients with high cytogenetic risk have poor outcomes. In CASTOR, daratumumab plus bortezomib/dexamethasone (D-Vd) prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus bortezomib/dexamethasone (Vd) alone and exhibited tolerability in patients with relapsed or refractory MM (RRMM). METHODS: This subgroup analysis evaluated D-Vd versus Vd in CASTOR based on cytogenetic risk, determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization and/or karyotype testing performed locally. High-risk patients had t(4;14), t(14;16), and/or del17p abnormalities. Minimal residual disease (MRD; 10(-5) sensitivity threshold) was assessed via the clonoSEQ® assay V2.0. Of the 498 patients randomized, 40 (16%) in the D-Vd group and 35 (14%) in the Vd group were categorized as high risk. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 40.0 months, D-Vd prolonged median PFS versus Vd in patients with standard (16.6 vs 6.6 months; HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.19-0.37; P < 0.0001) and high (12.6 vs 6.2 months; HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.83; P = 0.0106) cytogenetic risk. D-Vd achieved deep responses, including higher rates of MRD negativity and sustained MRD negativity versus Vd, regardless of cytogenetic risk. The safety profile was consistent with the overall population of CASTOR. CONCLUSION: These updated data reinforce the effectiveness and tolerability of daratumumab-based regimens for RRMM, regardless of cytogenetic risk status.

AB  - Background: In 2 randomized phase 3 trials of RRMM patients (pts), DRd (POLLUX) or DVd (CASTOR) significantly improved PFS and deepened responses compared with Rd or Vd alone, respectively. The novel mechanism of action of daratumumab (D) may improve the poor prognosis associated with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities in RRMM. Therefore, we examined the efficacy of DRd and DVd among RRMM pts with standard (std) or high cytogenetic risk status. Methods: Bone marrow aspirates were collected at screening and assessed centrally via next generation sequencing (NGS). Pts with high-risk cytogenetics included those who had ≥1 of the following abnormalities: t(4;14), t(14;16), or del17p; std-risk pts were defined as those confirmed negative for these abnormalities. Efficacy analyses included PFS and ORR. Results: Samples from 311/569 pts in POLLUX and 353/498 pts in CASTOR were assessed via NGS. In POLLUX, the median duration of follow-up was 17.3 months. Significantly longer median PFS and numerically higher ORR were observed with DRd vs Rd among high-risk patients, and significant improvements in these outcomes were observed in std-risk patients (Table). In CASTOR, the median duration of followup was 13.0 months. Significantly longer median PFS and higher ORR were observed with DVd vs Vd among both high- and std-risk pts (Table). Concordance rates for t(4;14), t(14;16), and del17p were high (88%-98%) between NGS and FISH. Updated data, including subgroup analyses, will be presented. Conclusions: In RRMM pts, the addition of D to standard-of-care regimens improved outcomes regardless of cytogenetic risk status. Targeting CD38 by combining D with Rd or Vd appears to improve the poor outcomes associated with high-risk cytogenetic status. (Table presented).

AB  - Introduction: Daratumumab (DARA), a human, IgGκ monoclonal antibody targeting CD38, is approved either as a single agent or in combination with anti-myeloma regimens for newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) or relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM). In phase 3 studies, DARA-based regimens reduced the disease progression or death risk by ≥44%, nearly doubled the rates of complete response (CR) or better, and tripled minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity rates (10-5 sensitivity threshold) in NDMM or RRMM pts (Palumbo A, et al. N Engl J Med 2016. 375[8]:754-766; Dimopoulos MA, et al. N Engl J Med 2016. 375[14]:1319-1331; Mateos MV, et al. N Engl J Med 2018. 378[6]:518-528; Facon T, et al. N Engl J Med 2019. 380[22]2104-2015). In the phase 3 CASTOR study (median follow-up 40.0 mo), D-Vd reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 69% and induced higher rates of deeper responses vs Vd in RRMM pts. Pts who received 1 prior line (PL) of therapy achieved the greatest benefit with D-Vd. Here, we examine updated (47.0 mo median followup) efficacy and safety of D-Vd vs Vd in CASTOR, with a focus on pts with 1 PL of therapy. Methods: In CASTOR, pts were randomized to 8 cycles (21 d/cycle) of V (1.3 mg/m2, SC) on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and dexamethasone (20 mg, PO or IV) on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 ± DARA (16 mg/kg, IV) given weekly for Cycles 1-3, Q3W for Cycles 4-8, and Q4W thereafter. Cytogenetic risk was evaluated by local fluorescence in situ hybridization or karyotyping; high risk was defined as the presence of t(4;14), t(14;16), or del17p abnormalities. Results: A total of 498 pts were randomized (D-Vd, n = 251; Vd, n = 247) and included in the intentto- treat (ITT) population. A total of 235 pts had 1 PL of therapy (D-Vd, n = 122; Vd, n = 113). After a median follow-up of 47.0 mo, progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly prolonged with D-Vd vs Vd in the ITT population (median: 16.7 vs 7.1 mo; HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.25-0.39, P <0.0001). The PFS benefit for D-Vd vs Vd was maintained in pts with prior V (median: 12.1 vs 6.7 mo; HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.26-0.46, P <0.0001), with prior R (median: 9.5 vs 6.1 mo; HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.28-0.58, P <0.0001), and high (median: 12.6 vs 6.2 mo; HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.83, P = 0.0106) and standard cytogenetic risk (median: 16.6 vs 6.6 mo; HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.18-0.36, P <0.0001). D-Vd significantly prolonged PFS on the subsequent line of therapy (PFS2) vs Vd (median: 34.6 vs 20.7 mo; HR, 0.47, 95% CI, 0.37-0.59; P <0.0001; Figure 1A). At the time of analysis, 114 deaths with D-Vd and 132 deaths with Vd were observed with 3-yr overall survival (OS) rates of 61% vs 51%, respectively; follow-up for OS is ongoing. The overall response rate (ORR; 85% vs 63%), ≥very good partial response (VGPR) rate (63% vs 29%) and ≥CR rate (30% vs 10%) were all significantly higher (all P <0.0001) with D-Vd vs Vd. Among 1 PL pts, median PFS was 27.0 vs 7.9 mo (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.15-0.31, P <0.0001) for D-Vd vs Vd. The PFS benefit for D-Vd vs Vd was maintained among 1 PL pts previously exposed to V (median: 20.4 vs 8.0 mo; HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.13-0.37; P <0.0001) or R (median: 21.2 vs 7.0 mo; HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11-0.82; P = 0.0140). PFS2 was also significantly prolonged with D-Vd vs Vd in 1 PL pts (median: not reached vs 23.4 mo; HR, 0.34, 95% CI, 0.24-0.49; P <0.0001; Figure 1B); 42-mo PFS2 rates were 58% vs 19%, respectively. For 1 PL pts, 39 vs 56 deaths were observed with D-Vd vs Vd, with 3-yr OS rates of 76% vs 57%, respectively. ORR (92% vs 74%; P = 0.0007) and rates of ≥VGPR (77% vs 42%; P <0.0001) and ≥CR (43% vs 15%; P <0.0001) were all significantly higher with D-Vd vs Vd. Additional data including MRD analyses will be presented. The most common (≥5%) grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with D-Vd vs Vd included thrombocytopenia (46% vs 33%), anemia (16% vs 16%), neutropenia (14% vs 5%), pneumonia (10% vs 10%), lymphopenia (10% vs 3%), hypertension (7% vs 1%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (5% vs 7%). Discontinuation rates due to TEAEs were similar for D-Vd vs Vd % vs 9%). The rate of invasive second primary malignancy rates were 4.9% in the D-Vd group vs 1.7% in the Vd group. Conclusions: In this updated analysis of CASTOR, D-Vd maintains significant PFS and ORR benefits in RRMM, with the greatest benefit achieved by pts who received 1 PL of therapy. The safety profile of D-Vd remains consistent with longer follow-up, with no new safety concerns reported. These data continue to suggest that administration of D-Vd to RRMM pts after first relapse may provide the greatest clinical benefit. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Background: DARA is a human, anti‐CD38 IgGÎº monoclonal antibody that significantly reduced the risk of progression/death with a manageable safety profile across several phase 3 studies in relapsed/refractory MM and NDMM. DARA + VRd (D‐VRd) demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in the safety run‐in cohort of the ongoing phase 2 GRIFFIN study that included transplant‐eligible NDMM pts. To determine whether D‐VRd demonstrates efficacy and tolerability in NDMM pts for whom transplant is not intended as initial therapy, the phase 3 CEPHEUS study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of D‐VRd vs VRd alone in this pt population. Methods: This is an ongoing multicenter, open‐label, randomized phase 3 study of D‐VRd vs VRd alone in pts with NDMM for whom transplant is not intended as initial therapy. Approximately 360 pts will be stratified by ISS stage and age/transplant eligibility (age < 70 years and transplant‐ineligible, or age < 70 years and refusal to transplant, or age â‰¥70 years) and will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. All pts will receive eight 21‐day cycles of VRd (V: 1.3 mg/m2 SC Days 1, 4, 8, 11; R: 25 mg PO Days 1‐14; d: 20 mg PO/IV Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12), followed by 28‐day cycles of Rd (R: 25 mg PO Days 1‐21; d: 40 mg PO/IV Days 1, 8, 15, 22) until progressive disease (PD). Patients in the DARA group will also receive subcutaneous DARA (1,800 mg co‐formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 [rHuPH20; Halozyme]) weekly in Cycles 1‐2, every 3 weeks in Cycles 3‐8, and every 4 weeks in Cycles 9+ until PD. All pts will receive preinfusion medications. Minimal residual disease (MRD)‐negative rate at 10‐5 sensitivity threshold by NGS is the primary endpoint. MRD will be evaluated at suspected complete response or better. Secondary endpoints include progression‐free survival (PFS), MRD‐negative rate at 1‐year, durable MRD negativity, overall response rate, time to and duration of response, PFS on next line of therapy, overall survival, clinical efficacy in high‐risk molecular subgroups, health‐related quality of life, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and safety.
